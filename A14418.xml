            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

After that he was growen to mans eſtate, and his Parents both dead, he married a wife, of an honeſt, though poore family, like vnto himſelfe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to diſpoſe and ſet in order that little meanes which he had, ſtill following his manuall art of Huſbandrie, labouring for day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wages and hire, for other Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen of the Countrey that were rich, and had landes of their owne to manure. But yet with all he had got a pious cuſtome and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19779:4"/>vſe, which grew vp with him euen from his Childhood, to heare Maſſe dailie before hee began to labour, Which he neuer omitted, though there were neuer ſo great haſt of worke to be done.</p>
               <p>And for this cauſe, certaine of his neighbours, through the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the diuell (who now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to make hoate war vpon S. Iſidore for his ſanctitie and holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of life which they could not endure) ſtirred vp againſt him his maiſter, of whom he had taken a peece of ground to plow, and was to labour by the day, complaining grieuouſly of him, that he came euery day very late to worke and that beſides, he omitted the ſame oftentimes in the day and went to his praiers. His mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the Farmer was much incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt him, by hearing this their accuſation, and one day fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into a fit of choller at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portes, preſently went vnto him
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:19779:5"/>in the field, to ſee if it were true or no which they had told him by way of complaint. And comming in all haſt vnto the field, where S. Iſidore was to be at his work, he ſaw three plowes going, two whereof were drawne &amp; gouerned by Angels in the likenes of young men, cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in moſt pure and white gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>At the firſt ſight whereof ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding amazed, he drew neeres vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, when vpon the ſudaine they vanished away. Heere vpon he came to S. Iſidore, whom hee found at the other plow, &amp; ſeeing ſo much worke done beyond his expectation, he fel downe at his ſeruants feete, and cryed him par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for ſo eaſily beleuing the falſe reportes, his neighbours had made of him, aſſuring himſelfe of the trueth of the wordes which Saint Iſidore had often told him, to wit, <hi>that how much time ſoeuer he spent in prayer, the ſame was recompenſed larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:19779:5"/>in his worke, by the handes of his ſweete Sauiour, and rather to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, then any way to the leſt hinderance or loſſe of his Maiſter.</hi> And ſo he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted with confuſion in himſelfe, and full of loue and reuerence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his ſeruant.</p>
               <p>As ſoone as his ſaid maiſter was departed, the Angels returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine vnto the plowes, and as they laboured, they taught S. Iſidore, and inſtructed him in many my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of his faith, accompanying him all that day vntill night, going home with him alſo, euen to his houſe, whither when hee came he found a poore Pilgrime at his doore, asking an almes of meate, for the refreshing of his body, who calling his wife, and bidding her giue the Pilgrime ſome what to eate, shee replyed ſadly, and ſaid, there was nothing in the houſe.</p>
               <p>Hee bid her looke into the Potte for ſome Pottage and Flesh:
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:19779:6"/>but she knowing that al was ſpent ſaid there was aſſuredly none left, and withall she tooke vp the Pot into her hands to shew that it was empty. But behold a wonder, for she felt the Pot heauy, and looke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereinto, found it full of very excellent Pottage &amp; Flesh, where with she fed the Pilgrime liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and with admiration acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the miracle: her huſband in the meane time with drawing himſelfe into an inner roome, and falling to his praiers as his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome was. The ſame night he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſleepe, the ſaid Pilgrime ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared vnto him againe in the ſame habit, that he had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Euening, and ſeemed to awake him, and put vpon him a Pilgrims weede, and ſayling o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the ſeas, conducted him to the holy land, whether when he was come, he shewed him all the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of chiefe note, where our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour had taught, preached, was
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:19779:6"/>taken, examined, whipped, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and laſtlie ſuffered death for our ſakes. Which places S. Iſido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re ſemed to reuerence, and greatly to adore, with guſt and affection of hart, and afterward was preſently conueyed backe to his own houſe, where the Pilgrime tooke his leaue and departed.</p>
               <p>Vpon a time in a great Froſt and Snow, one <hi>Iohn de Vargas</hi> a Farmer ſent Saint Iſidore to the Mill with a ſacke of wheate, to haue it ground to make bread for his family. Saint Iſidore tooke the ſacke of corne early in the morning, and paſſing by a Church, he went in to heare Maſſe, as his vſuall cuſtome was, which when he had done, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted on towards the Mill, and mett on the way others of the ſame vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage that went alſo thither with wheate in like manner. As they went talking and diſcourſing, they ſaw a great weather beaten tree growing in the way, on the bowes
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:19779:7"/>whereof ſate white Piggeons ſo thicke, as they ſeemed euen to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the whole tree, being flocked together and almoſt ſtarued for want of foode that hard ſeaſon, the ground being euery where co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered with ſnow &amp; yce. Saint Iſidore when he drew neere vnto the tree cryed out with a loud voice and ſaid: O Earth, the Mother of all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing creatures, why doeſt thou at this time deny food vnto theſe thy innocent Creatures? And then hee ſet downe his ſacke of wheat, and putting away the ſnow with his feete, vncouered a great broad place of the ground, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Corne out of the ſacke, hee ſtrawed it there for the Piggeons, who all preſently came from the tree, and before they would eate thereof did come to Saint Iſidores feete, and with their beckes tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and pricked them, and his legges, in ſigne of reuerence to his ſanctitie, and hauing ſo done, did
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:19779:7"/>feed themſelues on the Corne. One of his Company that all this while ſtoode by, and looked on, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to murmure againſt him, for ſo deſtroying and caſting away his maiſters wheate, but the reſt were ſilent and ſtoode amazed at the thing. Then taking vp his ſacke, which was well emptied by his liberality to Gods creatures, he came to the Mill, and put what was left to grinding, where the flower thereof did ſo multiplie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Milſtones, that he had his ſacke as full of excellent meale (and more in meaſure alſo) as if he had not diminished any one graine of the corne. So as the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle was manifeſt to al that knew what had paſſed.</p>
               <p>Another time, when at night his worke was ended, going home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from the field, he went into a Church to pray, ſo as it being late before he came home, ſupper was ended, and the other workemen
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:19779:8"/>had eaten vp al the meate, ſaue on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a little morſell of flesh &amp; pottage, which they had reſerued for him. Hee tooke the ſame very conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly, and carrying it to the dore, he there began to diſtribute it amongſt a great number of poore people and pilgrims that paſſed by, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hould, the ſaid meate did ſo multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in his hands, in the diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, that he ſerued a great multitude therewith before he ended, and euery one went away content &amp; ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>It ſo fell out at another time, vpon a very hoate day in ſommer, that his maiſter or Land-Lord, comming into the field where he was at worke, and being much par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with heare, demamded if there were no water neere, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to quench his thirſt. Saint Iſidore ſaid, there was a litle ſpring not far off, and shewed him the place. The man went ſpeedily to quench his thirſt, but finding neither ſpring,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:19779:8"/>nor anie ſigne of water at all, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned in great anger, and thought Saint Iſidore had mocked him. Wherevpon the Saint ſaid, Come with me againe to the place, and I will shew it you. They went, and when they came thither there was no ſigne of any water, but Saint Iſidore pricking the earth with a little goade he had in his hand, there preſently ſprung vp a very cleere, and excellent fountaine of water, which being taken by ſicke perſons, infinit number are daily cured of all kind of diſeaſes. And this miraculous fountaine is yet euen ſeene in the fields, not far from the Cittie of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid, and is viſited with great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of people daily, both from farre and neere.</p>
               <p>The diuell enuying the ſanctity and ſimplicity of this holy man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to deuiſe many plots and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines wherwith to entrappe him in his ſnares. And therfore he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited ſome of his neighbours, to

Which when Saint Iſidore had oftentimes heard iterated in his cares, he was much afflicted and troubled in mind, for that the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor therof began now to be ſpread abroad amonghſt his friends to his great diſgrace, as they pretented, and he beleeued. His wife whoſe name was Marie (being alſo a verie vertuous Godly woman) vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding thereof, and ſeeing her lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Huſband perplexed and troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led therewith, ſaid vnto him Deare Husband, I vnderſtand, and ſee alſo by your countenance, that you are much troubled with ſuſpition of my Chaſtity: but be aſſured thereof there is no ſuch thing, and that it is a meere Calumniation of both our honour: In teſtimonie and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation whereof, I am euen now ready to paſſe ouer this Riuer (which was hard by) vpon the water, truſting wholy in the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:19779:9"/>of Gods mercy to cleere my ſelfe of this lewd imputation. And thereupon she preſently tooke her mantle and going to the great Riuer of Xamara, ſpread the ſame vpon the water, and ſate downe vpon it, and paſſed ouer without any hurt or danger. This being done in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of her Husband, and of many people, shee was fully cleered of all ſuſpition, and the thing accounted for a manifeſt mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.</p>
               <p>S. Iſidore, being much comforted in ſoule by the foreſaid miracle, did very much honour his wife al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes after for her vertue, till her dying day, which (full of holynes) followed ſome few yeares after, and he left alone, who continually beſtowed his time, and followed the manner of life he was accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vnto before, but yet neuer omitted his hearing of Maſſe euery day, before he would take any worke in hand, nor his other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotions
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:19779:10"/>at diuers times in the day, as his vſuall manner was. He often alſo repayred to an Hermitage neere to Madrid, and ſpent many whole dayes and nights in pious diſcourſing with the Hermite, who was a Monke and a very holy man, and famous alſo for the gift of Propheſy, of whom Saint Iſidore learned many thinges touching piety and deuotion, and was ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wonderfully illuminated alſo in many miſteries of our Holy Faith, eſpecially touching our B. Lady, to whome he was alwayes moſt deuout, ſaying his beades many times a day in her honour.</p>
               <p>The holy Monke alſo inſtructed him, and taught him many other diuine thinges, whereby S. Iſidore was greatly inflamed with deſire of that kind of life, but yet he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſtill reſigned to the will of God. By the Hermites counſell al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, he entred into the Confrater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Roſarie of our Bleſſed
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:19779:10"/>Lady, with great deuotion and exact obſeruance of all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ules and Conſtitutions of the ſaid Confrater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and to the great edification of all his fellowes. And there was a cuſtome in that Confraternity that on certaine dayes a diſtribution of bread and wine was made amongſt the Sodales therof and a certaine part aſſigned to each one, which he had for his owne vſe. Alwayes at theſe diſtributions, Saint Iſidore gaue awaie his part to the poore. And on a time it happend, that his part aſſigned by the Confraternity, arriued to a good quantity, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for the reliefe almoſt of twenty perſons: Wherevpon he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the bread and wine home to his houſe inuited all the poore peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple round about, who flocked thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in great numbers, to whom he began to diſtribute the ſame with his owne hands, and it multiplied ſo much, that it ſufficed three hundred perſons, all being ſatisfied,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:19779:11"/>and prayſing God for the great libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality beſtowed vpon them, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging the miracle.</p>
               <p>Other Miracles which hee wrought in his life time are innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable, and would fill a great vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume to recount them al. But thoſe which haue happened ſince his death at his holy Body, by his interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to God, are ſat more in number, ſome few only whereof according to the breuity this place requireth shalbe recounted afterwards, when we haue ſaid a word or two of his death, which happened as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
               <p>In the yeare of our Lord 1170. which was the laſt of his life, whem by diuine Reuelation, hee knewe that his death drew neare, hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to haue the B. Sacrament brought vnto him, which hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued with great Reuerence and Deuotion, and after made a long and moſt deuour ſpeech to thoſe of his houſehould and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:19779:11"/>preſent, exhorting them to liue Chriſtian-like, and in the feare of God, and obſeruations of his holy Commandements. And ſo with a moſt ſweete and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable Countenance, rich in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, and famous for miracles, he quietly and moſt happely gaue vp his ſoule to God.</p>
               <p>When the bruite of his happy death was ſpread abroad, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Madrid came to ſee and to touch his holy body, whom many held for a Saint for the miracles which they had heard him to haue done, but eſpecially thoſe of the villages neere about, and of the poorer ſort of people, that were better acquainted with the manner of his life, and had ſeene, and bene preſent at many miracles, which he had wrought. Not-with-ſtanding becauſe he was exteriourlie poore, his body was buryed in the Churchyearde, in an ordinary Graue, among all other people,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:19779:12"/>where it remained for the ſpeace of 40. yeares, of whom all this while little or nothing more was ſpoken of, except it were amongſt the meaner ſort of people of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning Villages, who had byne beſt acquainted with him when he liued.</p>
               <p>But our Lord, who would haue this his Saint honored as well in earth as in heauen, at the ende of fourtie yeares, reuealed his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a pious and venerable Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron of <hi>Madrid,</hi> who had all this time bene very deuour vnto Saint Iſidore, for the miraculous things she had heard recounted of him by the fornamed <hi>Iohn de Vargas:</hi> wherfore to ſatisfie her deuotion, she dealt ſeriouſly with the Paſtour of the Village, to haue his body tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Church, and layed in ſome decent place therof, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to defray all the charges there about. The Paſtour being a vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens man, and hauing heard much
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:19779:12"/>talke of the miracles which he did when he liued, made further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirie thereof, and found that hee was in deede a very holy and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent man, and that the Fountaine which was cloſe by the village, and very profitable and commodious for all the people, for the excellent water there of, was mireculouſly rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed out of the ground by his merites: he dealt with the Bishop, expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto him the Matrons pious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and hauing obtained his licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, appointed a certaine day for the remouall of the ſaid body into the Church.</p>
               <p>In the meane time there was a little Vault propared, humble and decent, at the coſt of the foreſaid deuout Matron, where his body was appoynted to be layde. And when the day appointed came, the people there about reſorted to the ſolemnitie, according as the Paſtour had informed and inuited them. All being ready, the Paſtour
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:19779:13"/>with the reſt of the Clergy of the Church, came in manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceſſion to the Churchyard, and opening the Graue where his body lay, they found it whole and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt, and as fresh and faire, as if he had byne dead but the day before (it being fourtie years com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete after his deceaſe) and from the ſame there proceeded ſo ſweet and fragrant a ſmell, that it rauished all that were preſent. The graue was no ſooner opened, but all the bels of the ſteeple began to ring in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent tune and order, of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and ſo continued during the Ceremony, and vntill he was tranſlated into the Church, and laid in his new Sepulcher, to the aſtonishment of all that heard them: at which time alſo were hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led many perſons of many ſorts of diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>After his body was thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently laid in the Church, very many began to do great reuerence
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:19779:13"/>therto, and it pleaſed God to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, of what great merit &amp; eſteeme he would haue this his ſeruant to be, by the many and wonderfull mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles daily wrought at the ſame by his interceſſion, of ſome whereof we shall ſpeake a word. And firſt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with a continuall miracle, which remayneth euen vnto this day, the water of the fountaine which he mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly raiſed out of the ground, hath cured infinite people of all ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and infirmities, and is had in very great eſteeme by all the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants both of the Citty and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d about, where you shall ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cely find a houſe, who hath not ſome of the ſaid water continually preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in vialls of glaſſe or botles, ready for all infirmities or ſuddaine ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that may happen, eſpecially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, or blew ſpots. And when often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times there happeneth the ſicknes of the plague, the people find none ſo prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or aſſured remedy, as the water of the ſaid fountaine.</p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:19779:14"/>
               <p>Another miracle, that hath very often bene ſeene &amp; teſtified by thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of all ſorts of people is, that the Lampe which hangeth before his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher, hath bene oftentimes ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, without putting any fire therto by the induſtry of man. Nay which is more, when there hath wanted oyle in the lampe, and the ſame filled with water, the weeke hath burned as cleere, and as bright as with oyle. Which ſome curious perſons haue deſired to proue and they themſelues, both by putting in water, and lightning the weeke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would not belieue the ſame without their owne experience.</p>
               <p>The women of Spaine haue a very peculiar deuotion to S. Iſidore when they are great with child, &amp; in labour of Childbyrth, becauſe very many haue bene ſafely deliuered, by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion, and by commending the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnto him, in the extremity of their labour, &amp; at ſuch times as there hath bene little hope of life.</p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:19779:14"/>
               <p>Thoſe alſo who be troubled with the Gout, haue great deuotion vnto him, for that many haue bene holpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being in great extremity, and cured of that infirmity, by his merits and prayers.</p>
               <p>Vpon a time, there was a man who deſired to get a relique of the holy Saint, whether for himſelfe, or for another, is not certainly knowne. This man watching his opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and hiding himſelfe in the Church till all were gone thence, the dores being locked, came to the Tombe, and making shift to open a corner, ſo as he might reach vnto the holy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, cut off a finger from S. Iſidore, with intention to carry the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: and hauing put it vp into his pocket, and beginning to cloſe vp the Tombe againe, that the thieft might not be perceaued, he was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly there areſted, and made ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueable, that he could not ſtyr a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foote. Wherupon fearing exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be diſcouered and punished for
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:19779:15"/>fact, he tooke the finger and put it to the ioynt from which he had cut it, and it inſtantly faſtned therto againe, and thereupon he was preſently ſet at liberty; and ſo cloſing vp the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher departed, giuing God and S. Iſidore thankes, that no worſe euill had happened vnto him, being alſo very ſory for the rash attempt, which he had put in practice.</p>
               <p>There haue happened many times great Drouthes in thoſe partes for want of rayne, which hath cauſed ſuch barreneſſe of the ground, that the people haue bene ready to ſtarue for want of corne: but by carrying S. Iſidores ſacred body in proceſſion, the ſaid drouth hath preſently ceaſed, and raine hath ſo watered the earth, that it hath become preſently feuite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. And all the huſbandme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Spaine haue taken this holy Saint for their peculiar Patron, and doevſe, euen vntill theſe daies, whenſoeuer they ſowe corne, to pray vnto S. Iſidore, and call vpon him to bleſſe the ſame,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:19779:15"/>offering a candle or ſome ſuch like gift vnto his ſepulcher, by whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion they hope to haue a happy harueſt, and their piety in this kind is very ſeldome fruſtrated.</p>
               <p>Certaine Gentlemen of Spaine trauayling on a time by Coach, and paſſing a very ſtraite and narrow way vpon the ſide of a rocky hill, the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes beinge furious, and their footing ſlippery, they fell downe, drawing the Coach with the people in it after them, into a mighty precipice; who ſeeing the imminent danger cried for helpe to S. Iſidore, and preſently the horſes and Coach ſtaied, hanging vpon the ſide of the rocke as it were in the ayre, vntill the people all got out, and ſaued themſelues, to the number of 18. perſons, and afterward drew vp the horſes and Coach, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further hurt. For this ſo eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent a miracle they all gaue God and S. Iſidore thankes, and ſent donaries to his Tombe in teſtimony of the ſame. The Angelicall Muſicke, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:19779:16"/>celeſtiall harmony which hath bene often heard at his ſepulcher is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull, in ſo much, that infinite peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple haue witneſſed the ſame, hauing bene hearers therof to their great aſtonishment.</p>
               <p>His apparitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to many haue bene very illuſtrious, as may be read at lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge in the Hiſtory of his life; and in particular he appeared once to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonſus King of Caſtile, who making warre vpon the Moores, obtained a miraculous victory by his interceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; merits. As alſo he appared in a viſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at another time to one that lay ſicke (and was bereſt of all hope of life by the Phiſitians) bidding him take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and haue confidence in God, for that he should recouer, and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently he became wel, and receaued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine his perfect health.</p>
               <p>And to conclude, the benefits which many haue receaued by the infinite miraculous Cures done at his ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, are ſo many and great, that a whole volume might be witten ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:19779:16"/>For there are recounted aboue twenty blind perſons to haue recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued their perfect ſight, many deaſe &amp; du<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>be to haue recouered their hearing and ſpeach, many crooked, lame, and deformed, to haue receaued perfect ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ght and comlynes of body; many ſick of the palſy, to haue receaued perfect cure; and infinit others to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue bene deliuered from all kind of infirmity wherwith they haue bene oppreſſed.</p>
               <p>Finally the late famous miracle wrought vpon the perſon of the late King of Spaine Philip the third, is te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by thouſands of eye-witneſſes, that were preſent at the ſame. The ſubſtance wherof in brief was this. In the yeare of our Lord 1619. the ſaid King of famous memory going a Progreſſe into Portugall, to viſit that kingdome, together with the Prince and his other Children, after he had bene receaued with moſt noble and magnificent Triumphs, as well in Lisbone as other places, in his retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:19779:17"/>to Madrid, fell very dangerouſly ſicke of a hoar peſtilent feuer or Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berdillo, wherby he was in eminent danger of Death, and almoſt deſpai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of, by his Phiſitians. The court &amp; nobility were ſtrocken into feare at this ſuddaine chance, and this dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous infirmity of their King, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to the prayers and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion af all the people, eſpecially of Religious Orders: but he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuing, ſo 2. or 3. dayes with out ſigne of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, deſired to haue the holy Reliques of S. Iſidore brought vnto him, &amp; with all his force and ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of body and mind, humbly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelfe vnto him and his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, that therby it would pleaſe God, he might recouer his health: he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently felt himſelfe much better, the feuer relenting, and within a few daies after became perfectly well.</p>
               <p>As ſoone as he had recouered, he began to thinke how he might ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Saint, by rendering him
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:19779:17"/>thankes for ſo ſingular a benefit, and prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly determined to procure, with all endeauour, his Canonizatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to haue him the more knowne &amp; honoured throught the world: but the death of Pope Paulus V. as his owne alſo enſuing ſoone after, the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines was differred; yet on his death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed did he ſeriouſly commend the ſame, to Philip the fourth his Sonne, the now preſent King of Spaine, by whoſe interceſſion to the Sea Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicke, he was, with the greateſt honour and ſolemnity, that perhaps hath euer bene made in that kind, canonized for a Saint, by Pope Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory the XV. the 12. day of March in the yeare of our Lord 1622. in S. Peters Church at Rome, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by his memory might be famous to poſterity.</p>
               <p>His body being taken vp the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, and put into a coſtly Shrine 450. yeares after his death, was found wholy vncorrupt, ſending forth a moſt pleaſant and ſweet
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:19779:18"/>ſmell, to the aſtonishment of all Spaine, and ſo remayneth euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till this day.</p>
               <p>His life is written elegantly, and at large in Spanish Verſe, by Lopes de Vega Carpio, Secretary to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques of Sarria, by F. Peter Ribade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyra, D. Alfonſus Villegas in their Excrauagants and others.

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:19779:20"/>pennance and other vertues, this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Pilgrime came to Rome in the yeare of our Lord. 1523. from whence as ſonne as he had obtayned the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall ben diction (which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued from Pope Adrian the Sixt, &amp; that euen vpon Eaſter day) he went firſt to Venice, and afterwards to Hieruſalem. But when he had there viſited thoſe holy places, being afraid that he could not conueniently ſtay and imploy himſelfe in the ſaluation of ſoules in Paleſtine, he returned into Spaine; where, to the intent that he might the better procure the ſpirituall good of his neighbours, not withſtanding he was now thirty yeares old: firſt at Barcelona he ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died Grammer, then heard Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy and Diuinity in the Vniuerſity of Alcala, for the ſpace of a yeare and halfe: and after this againe at Paris he renewed all the ſame ſtudies, liuing all this while of almes, yet neuer lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing off, nor interrupting the workes of charity, humility and pennance,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:19779:21"/>which he was accuſtomed before to doe.</p>
               <p>At Paris he came acquainted with ſome others, whom he perſuaded to the ſame courſe of life, and they all together made this vow, that when their ſtudies were ended, all wordly things being deſpiſed, they should go to Hieruſalem, and there giue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues wholy to the ſaluation of ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les by preaching, teaching &amp;c. But if either within the ſpace of a yeare there should be no fit opportunity to faile, or that they should not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſtay at Hieruſalem, that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as being abſolued from the aforeſaid vow, they should go to Rome, and preſent their ſernice vnto the Pope for the ſpirituall helpe of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
               <p>But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with ouer much ſtudying and watching, Ignatius had fallen into a grieuous diſeaſe of the ſtomacke, by the appointment of the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, and his Companions aduiſe, he returned into his Countrey in the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:19779:21"/>yeare of our Lord 1535. and there in an hoſpitall of S. Mary Magdalen in begging his victuals from doore to doore, and ſeruing of the poore, he very carefully beſtowed the ſpace of three monthes: when hauing recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his health he went thence to Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice, whither his companions alſo of ſet purpoſe were to come, and in the ſame Citty receiued the holy Order of Prieſthood, and made a vow of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty and Chaſtity before the Lord Verall Archbishop of Roſan, who being then the Popes Legate, was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes created Cardinall.</p>
               <p>Now the yeare which they had agreed vpon for their pilgrimage being expired, and their ſayling into the holy Land hindered by the breach of peace betweene the Turkes &amp; the Venetians; Ignatius with his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, came to Rome in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the yeare of our Lord 1537. where being entertayned by Quiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Garzonius a Citizen of Rome, &amp; lodged in a certaine farme of his, at
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:19779:22"/>the foot of mount Pincius, he offered his ſeruice vnto the Pope with all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines poſſible, to be imployed in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his neighbours. Meane while by inſtructing the ruder ſort of people, in the principles of Chriſtian Faith, and by other godly and landable liuing, he founded and got confirmed his Order of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of Ieſus, for the defence and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the Carholike faith, &amp; good of ſoules. And albeit in the ſame So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety he ordayned three ſolemne Vowes, yet vnto thoſe (which are common to other Religious) he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a fourth vow, wherby he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a peculiar and ſpeciall Obedience to the Pope, in vndertaking of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions euen vnto the Turkes, and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dells themſelues whereſoeuer, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking any thing to beare their charges, and in teaching children the Chriſtian Doctrine. This being done, he wrote the Conſtitutions of the ſame Society, which he afterwards being chose<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Generall, gouerned with
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:19779:22"/>very great praiſe both for wiſedome and vertue; And laſtly after many la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and trauailes, hauing receiued of the Pope his Apoſtolicall benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with a plenary Indulgence of his ſinnes, calling vpon the Name of Ieſus, he piouſly repoſed in our Lord at Rome the laſt day of Iuly in the yeare of our Lord 1556. being of the age of threeſcore and fiue yeares, and ſixteene yeares after the Society was confirmed by the ſea Apoſtolike, at what time the ſame was extended almoſt throughout the whole world. For he left eſtablished twelue Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces, to wit, that of Portugall, of Caſtile, of Aragon, of Andaluzia, of all Italy (which comprehendeth Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardy &amp; Toſcan) of Naples, of Sicily, of Germany, of Franders, of France, of Braſile, and of the Eaſt Indies; and in theſe Prouinces there were at that time, about an hundred Colledges or Houſes of the Society.</p>
               <p>His body was buried firſt in a low and humble Tombe at the right band
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:19779:23"/>of the high Altar, in his owne little Church of our Bleſſed Lady at Rome, and afterward in the yeare 1587. it was tranſlated ſolemnely to the new and ſumptuous Church of the Caſa Proſeſſa, which Cardinall Alexander Farneſius had newly erected, &amp; there placed in a Vault at the Right hand of the high Altar, where it is yet reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced with concourſe of people fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all parts of the world, as well for his admirable life and ſanctity, as for the innumerable miracles that haue bene, and are daily wrought there at by his interceſſion, ſome wherof we shall relate, at the end of this narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, after we haue briefly laid downe his vertues, which follow in this manner: and firſt of his Faith.</p>
               <p>Such was the excellency of Faith, which the Holy Ghoſt by meanes of his peruſing the a foreſaid bookes before his Conuerſion, began to plat in the hart of Ignatius, that reading the wonderfull things which God had wrought with his Saintes, and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:19779:23"/>belieuing that he would deale in like ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner with him, if he should follow their ſteps, he therfore without any more adoe leauing all, followed only our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt. This ſame Faith made him ſo meekely and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently endure ſo many labours, and ouercome ſo many difficulties, in bringing to paſſe whatſoeuer he had once vndertake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the glory of God and ſaluation of ſoules. This confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him ſo ſtrongly in his poore and laborious courſe of life, not only by perpetuall perſeuerance, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding many great impediments; but alſo by a formall inſtitution of the ſame, eſtablished with ſolemne vowes.</p>
               <p>Finally hence aroſe that wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full care and diligence in procuring the conuerſion of Heretikes, Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matikes, Moores, Iewes, &amp; Inſidells: in preaching the Ghoſpell to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, Barbarians, and other natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s by meanes of S. Xauerius and other of his Society: and in alwayes teaching
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:19779:24"/>and holding the moſt ſound and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Doctrine as a true ſcholler of the Angelicall Doctour S. Thomas, neuer giuing care to any new fangled opinions, eſpecially about the ſacred myſteries of our Faith, which he ſo firmely belieued, that he was wont to ſay. That although there were no Scriptures for his warrant, yet was he ready with all his hart to ſuffer death in defence of the ſame faith, for ſo much only as God had imparted and reuealed vnto him while he was at Manreſa.</p>
               <p>Firſt out of this ſo well grounded root of Faith, ſprung vp that his moſt ſingular Hope; wherof his true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of all worldly things, his auſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re pennance, his rare confidence ſo little in himſelfe, and ſo much in Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, his wonderfull courage in ſtrong and hard enterpriſes for the glory of God, the delight and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure he tooke in the paines, reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and perſecutions which he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for Chriſt, and to be short, his
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:19779:24"/>moſt ſweet and continuall medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of death, are more then ſufficient teſtimonies.</p>
               <p>Secondly, his Charity towards his Neighbours was ſuch, that beſides his daily ſeruing of the poore and ſicke in Hoſpitalls, and not only curinge their bodies, but with moſt profound humility euen licking their botches and ſores, he alſo euery day went a begging fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doore to doore, beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the beſt part of the Almes he got, vpon the poore of the Hoſpitalls, and priſons of the Citty where he liued, contenting himſelfe with the refuſe, and worſt part of all.</p>
               <p>Extraordinary was the care he had to inſtruct children and ignorant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Chriſtian doctrine. And the zeale wherwith he was carried away in procuring the ſaluation of ſoules, could not be conteyned within the bounds of one Kingdome, but exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it ſelfe euen vnto Hieruſalem, whither after one pilgrimage, he vowed another, both for himſelfe &amp;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:19779:25"/>the reſt of his Society.</p>
               <p>For his Neighbours ſake, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the Booke of Spirituall Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which is one of the beſt that hath bene written in that kinde: for them he exceedingly furthered and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Confraternity of the Bleſſed Sacrament in his owne Countrey. For them he was not a bashed at the age of thirty yeares, to go to ſchoole amongſt litle boyes. To conclude, for them after he had ended his ſtudies at Paris, together with a few more that had entred there into his Society, he went to Rome, where for them he offered all his indeauours and ſeruice to the Pope; for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he inſtituted the Order it ſelfe of the Society, propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and multiplying the ſame with Miſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, Colledges, Churches, Schoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les and Vniuerſities, of all kind of ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, with other pious workes (beſides in particular the German Colledge, the Hoſpitalls of the Orphans and Cathecumens, the monaſteries of S. Martha and S. Katherine in Rome)
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:19779:25"/>throughout all the world, euery where by the exhortation &amp; admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of his ſubiects, teaching the people to frequent the Sacrament of Pennance, and holy Communion, Maſſe, Sermons, and other holy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes. And what wonder in him, who euen in the beginning of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion after he had bene grieuouſly beaten, and almoſt brought to the point of death at Barcelona, for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the ſaluation of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, did not only not complaine therof, but gaue God thankes for it, forgiuing and (to fulfill our Lords commandement) praying for his perſecutours. In ſo much that after he had recouered his health, he was not afraid to returne to his former wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of Charity, and to hazard his very life for his brethren; notwithſtanding all his friends diſſuading him from it, to whom he alwayes gaue this anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were: <hi>Quid mihi optabiliue quàm more pro Chriſte &amp; ſalute proximi mei?</hi> What can I wish for, that would be more
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:19779:26"/>gratefull and welcome to me, then to die for Chriſt, and the ſaluation of my neighbour?</p>
               <p>Thirdly if wee conſider how Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius did all that hath bene tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched aboue, meerly for the loue of God, how carefull he was euer from his firſt conuerſion to keepe his hart pure and cleane from all touch of mortall ſinne, either in word or deed; how ſtrictly, and often euery day he examined his conſcience, leaſt he should haue any thing in it that might diſpleaſe God, were it but the leaſt veniall negligence in his daily meditation, how he had withdrawne all his affection from all things that were not good, and fixed his whole hart vpon God; how he daily vſed to meditate vpon heauenly things; eftſoones ſtirring vp himſelfe to the loue of God, by a certaine Iaculatory prayer in his booke of Exerciſes which beginneth. <hi>Suſcipe Domine vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſam libertatem meam, &amp;c.</hi> How he leuelled all his thoughts, words, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:19779:26"/>deedes to the honour and glory of God, in ſo much as he had alwaies in his mouth (as a token of what was in his hart) this ſentence. <hi>Admaiorem Dei gloriam.</hi> If wee (I ſay) conſider all this, we shall, the leſſe wonder how he should out of the feruour of this charity, be forced to ſay, That he had rather if he were to haue his choiſe, remaine aliue with vncertainty of his ſaluation, to the end he might ſerue God in the meane time, then die and goe ſtraight to heauen: and moreouer he did perſuade himſelfe, if God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty should euer thruſt him downe to hell, that it would be a greater torment for him, to heare thoſe hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible blaſphemies againſt the name of God, then to be tortured with the moſt cruell paynes that the damned ſuffer.</p>
               <p>Whatſoeuer he tooke in hand, firſt he commended it to God Almighties prouidence and aſſiſtance; then he maturely conſulted and examined what meanes he was to vſe, and what
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:19779:27"/>impediments he was to auoyd which done, with great confidence and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, he achieued his intent &amp; finall end, which was alwaies the glory of God.</p>
               <p>The great deſire he had to ſatisfie Gods diuine Iuſtice for his ſinnes paſt, made him in Monſerat, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſa and Barcelona, goe cloathed in ſackcloath, and girded about the very bare skin with a chaine of iron. It made him oftentimes goe barefoot, &amp; that he might eſchew vaine glory, to cut out the ſoles of his shooes: It made him ſleepe vpon the bare boards and grounde, afflicting and punishing his body with iron whippes and diſcipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, faſting and other ſuch like mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications.</p>
               <p>To theſe may be added the feruour of his Deuotion; the abundance of his teares; his daily prayer; his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or ſaying of Maſſe euery day; his frequenting of the Sacraments; his viſiting of holy places; ſingular deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our B. Lady; to the Angels,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:19779:27"/>Saints, and holy Reliques. Finally, his perfect keeping and fulfilling of the vowes of Pouerty, Chaſtity and perpetuall Obedience, which he had made in the Society.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, touching his vprightnes towards his neighbour, his words were alwaies ſincere, plaine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid of all deceipt or flattery: his hart was pure and ſimple, euer taking all things in good part.</p>
               <p>His inuincible courage, could not be quailed with the many and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous tentations he had in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge of his conuerſion; nor with the manifold diſeaſes he got in viſiting of the ſicke; No nor all the iniuries, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, nor difficulties he found (which were without number) were able ſo much as once to turne him backe, much leſſe hinder him from attayning vnto his deſired end.</p>
               <p>He tooke great pleaſure in ſeeing himſelfe wronged, and diſgraced, ſtill requiting his enemies with ſpeciall fauours and benefits.</p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:19779:28"/>
               <p>All the time he was at Manreſa &amp; Barcelona, his fare was bread and water euery day, except Sundaye.</p>
               <p>Once in a Chappel at Villadord, and another time in the Caue before mentioned, what with continuall prayer, what with abſtinence, he was found ſo leane and weake, that he was ſcarce able to ſtand. But at Barcelona by reaſon of the ſame extraordinary mortification, he fell into ſo grieuous a ſicknes, that he would hardly haue eſcaped death, if a certaine pious and charitable woman, had not taken care of him, which he not without ſome difficulty admitting, ſaid: <hi>Sinite me pati haec leuia vt ſaluetur anima mea:</hi> let me ſuffer theſe trifles, that my ſoule may be ſaued.</p>
               <p>Out of the wonderfull great care he had of Caſtity, both in himſelfe &amp; his ſubiects, proceeded that clauſe of his Conſtitutions, to wit, That thoſe who were of his Society, should ſtriue to imitate the purity of Angels, both in mind and body.</p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:19779:28"/>
               <p>After he had once made a purpoſe to change his life, he could not indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re to heare his brother talke of his Nobility, Riches, Warlike Proweſſe, and the like, but as ſoone as he was well, he forſooke the world. And once comming neere home into his natiue ſoyle, to recouer his health, for feare of being honoured by his brother &amp; other inhabitants, if they should haue notice of him, he left the company of one of his acquaintance, and paſſing through deſert mountaines and by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, made choice rather of a poore Hoſpitall, then of his Fathers Hall. Thus euery where as much as he could, ſtill hiding his Nobility, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes shunned the ſpeach and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation of ſuch as he thought would know him. But if it were his chaunce in any place to meere with any that did know him, or tooke ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with him, he would be ſure neuer to returne to that place any more.</p>
               <p>This rare contempt he had, not
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:19779:29"/>only of the worlde, but euen of his owne perſon, is ſufficiently ſeene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in his poore and meane kind of liuing, and in taking ſuch pleaſure when he heard any thing ſpoken or done to his owne diſgrace.</p>
               <p>When he was choſen Generall of the Society of Ieſus (which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe hauing inſtituted deſired ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it should be accounted and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The leaſt of all Religious</hi>) he altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther refuſed to vndertake the charge, till ſuch time as his Ghoſtly Father comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded him to take it vpon him. And againe ten yeares after, perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſtill in the ſame Humility, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauoured by all meanes poſſible to be put out of the office, alleadging that he himſelfe was not fit to beare it.</p>
               <p>Hauing taken the office vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, firſt he beſtowed ſome dayes in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Cooke in the kitchin, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards began to teach children the Chriſtian Doctrine, according to his Conſtitutions, that he might ſeale
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:19779:29"/>with his owne example the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Humility, which he was to propoſe vnto others.</p>
               <p>He did what he could to conceale his owne vertues and heauenly vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s; intermingling euer in his ſpeach ſome words or other of humility, as <hi>Miſerum me, miſeram animam meam.</hi> Wo is me wretch, wo is my wretched ſoule. Nay and which is more, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he was wont to ſay, that If he were to aske a boone of Almighty God at the houre of his death, this he would be ſure to requeſt of him, that he would permit him to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in a dunghil, becauſe he eſteemed himſelfe as dunge. And to this many times he added, that he was much edified with the example and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of all but himſelfe; and in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Epiſtle he wrote, that he neuer had conference or communication about ſpirituall matters with any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were he neuer ſo bad, that he did not reape ſome profit by him.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the reſt of the miracles
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:19779:30"/>of this great ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God, we might well account this one and not the leaſt, to wit, the wonderfull light and knowledge he had in ſpirituall things as by the reſtimony of Pope Iulius the third, in the beginning of his booke of Spirituall exerciſes, is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently declared.</p>
               <p>Miraculous was that brightnes which S. Philip Nerius, and Father Oliuer Mannareus ſaw shine in his face whiles he liued. And no leſſe miraculous was the ſpeedy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>courſe and flocking of the people vnto his body, as ſoone as he was dead, and the continuall veneration and viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting not only of his Sepulchre, but alſo of his Chamber, his Caue, and other places wherin he had done pennance.</p>
               <p>But beſides theſe, God Almighty by interceſſion of this Saint, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after his happy death wrought many miracles, which are to be ſeene more at large in the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion out of which this ſumme is
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:19779:30"/>taken, and in other hiſtories of his life. I will heere only rehearſe, ſome few of them for our better inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and further declaration of his ſanctity.</p>
               <p>And firſt his great charity &amp; zeale in procuring the ſaluation of ſoules, was miraculouſly confirmed in that, when a certaine man whoſe name was Liſſanus, for being caſt in a ſuite of law, and hanged himſelfe, and was by all mens iudgment ſtone dead; he by his prayers obtayned of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty ſo much time for him to line againe, that might ſerue his turne to be ſorry for his ſinnes, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e them to a Prieſt, and receaue Abſolution.</p>
               <p>Secondly to increaſe our deuotion to holy Reliques, that may ſuffice which happened to Bartholomew Conteſti, a Chirurgeon and Cittizen of Maiorca, who was ſo tormented with a continual headach, that for ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemency of the paine, he was diuerſe times forced to fal dowen to the very
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:19779:31"/>ground. And beſides this, he had ſo grieuous a diſeaſe in one of his eyes, that being vnable to behold the leaſt glimpſe of light, he was fayne to be shut vp in a darke chamber, eating no meat but what others put into his mouth. As many and ſundry medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes were applied as could be deuiſed, but all in vaine, for his diſeaſe ſtill waxed worſe and worſe. In ſo much that Bartholomew, out of the intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable paine he felt, was not afraid to proteſt, if a certaine Chirurgeon, whoſe name was Paſtor, were aliue, that he would cauſe him to placke out his eye by the very roote. But as he lay, now in this pittifull eſtate, hearing by good chaunce of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold miracles that were euery where wrought by the interceſſion of S. Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius, with great deuotion and hope of recouery by this meanes, he deſired that they would bring him one of his ſubſcriptions, or writings of his owne hand: which was no ſooner brought vnto him, but he found himſelfe well

And that he might be the better aſſured that this ſo ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine a cure was to be attributed to the diuine power, and to the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of this ſeruant of God S. Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius, for two or three ſeuerall ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, the Relique was no ſoner taken away out of his chamber, but his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer paine returned vnto him; and the ſame Relique was no ſooner brought backe againe into the chamber, but his paine left him. So that Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mew was aduiſed to keepe the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que alwayes about him, &amp; thus with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in three or foure dayes, he came to be ſo perfectly well, as if he had neuer bene ſicke.</p>
               <p>In Rome a Lady called Druſilla Turſellina, being very much vexed with a vehement ſeuer, and with the head-ach, hauing vſed many reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and bene let blood in her armes, noſtrills, and head, without profit, her
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:19779:32"/>ſicknes rather increaſing euery day; was preſently healed by a relique of one of the Bleſſed Fathers bones, laid vpon her forehead.</p>
               <p>Another woman named Olimpia Norina, had ſuch a veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t paine in her eyes, that she came to looſe her ſight, &amp; for the ſpace of three moneths had ſuch a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall ague, &amp; paine in her head, that she could notreſt. They brought her a ſubſcription of the Bleſſed Fathers hand, at the time that her paine was at the greateſt, laying it vpon her forehead, and eyes, &amp; she began to ſee, and was ryd of her ague and paine.</p>
               <p>In the ſame Citty in the yeare 1597. a noble mans child of ſeauen yeares old, called Hierome Gabriell, being ſick of a peſtilent ſeuer (called a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berdillo) and of a pluriſy, hauing alſo the wormes, ſo that there was little hope of his life, was healed with the ſame ſubſcription of the Bleſſed Father.</p>
               <p>In the yeare 1599. the Lady Ioane
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:19779:32"/>Vrſina, being but a child, daughter to Cornelia Vrſina Ducheſſe of Ceſi, had ſo great a cough, that she could ſcarcely breath or ſuck. The Dutches her mother comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded her very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly and deuoutly to bleſſed Father Ignatius, and beſeeched him to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the health of her daughter: wherevpon the child hauing bene a night and a halfe without reſt, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently fell a ſleepe, and her cough cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, &amp; she began to ſucke her Nurſes breaſt. For which cauſe the Dutches commaunded a Tablet to be ſet on the Fathers graue, in remembrance of the fauour she had receiued.</p>
               <p>In the ſame yeare 1599. Angella Ruggiera was troubled with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary noiſe in her head for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a yeare, and loſt the hearing of her right eare; wherto applying a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique of the Bleſſed Father, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a vow to faſt with bread and water the day of his departure, and to communicate the day following, recouered perfect health, and remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:19779:33"/>free from that infirmity.</p>
               <p>In the Citty of Naples, in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of Iune of the yeare 1599, Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na of Aragon, Princeſſe of Beltran, &amp; Dutcheſſe of Terra-noua, had a great payne, and ſwelling in her right bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſt: and finding no remedy, amongſt many which were applied in the ſpace of foure moneths, omitting, them all, as vnprofitable, and laying vpon her breaſt, with much deuotion, the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the Bleſſed Father, she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came well the ſame day: and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to Rome the laſt Holy yeare of 1600. commaunded a tablet of ſiluer, with foure great waxe Tapers to be ſet vpon the Bleſſed Fathers tombe, on Eaſter day, in thankſgiuing.</p>
               <p>In the Citty of Nola, the yeare 1599. in the moneth of Noue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, a knight named Francis Blaſius, being much vexed with a peſtilent ague, and with a grieuous paine in his head and ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, ſo that in the iudgement of the Phiſitians he was in danger of his life, his mother Zenobia Tolphia ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:19779:33"/>him to lay a relique of the bone of Bleſſed Father Ignatius to his head, and to commend himſelfe vnto him, deſiring his fauour. He did ſo, and remayned free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all his paines, and his whole ſicknes.</p>
               <p>In the Citty of Lecha (which is in the Prouince of Apulia, in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Naples) a child of three yeares old, ſonne to the Baro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li-boni, fell from his Nurſes armes vpon the ground, and did notably hurt his right knee, which grew eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day worſe, becauſe the Nurſe for feare concealed the fall, and it went ſo far, that it was neceſſary to open the childs knee oftener then once, &amp; this helped not: wherfore co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to cut it the third time, the Father fearing his Sonnes death (whome he did ſee conſumed with the wound, and with the ague which followed thervpon) went to the Colledge of the Society, and there they gaue him a Relique of the Bleſſed Fathers bone; which he laid vpon the child, before they ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:19779:34"/>his knee the third time, and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Surgeons came to doe it, they found him much better, and within a few dayes altogether well.</p>
               <p>I will conclude with one more, which very much confirmeth the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neratiou of holy Images and pictures. In the yeare of our Lord 1603. in Vall dolid a principall Cirty of Spai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, one Ferdinand Pretel of Mendoza vpon the 29. day of September, had fallen into a ſingle Tertian ague, which not many days after came dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and doubling ſo long vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, till at laſt it was turned into a peſtile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t feuer, which ſome call the blacke ague, the Spaniards, Taberdillo, and fot all the Phiſicke he tooke in great abundance, it brought him at length to ſo deſperate a caſe, that now quite and cleane beinge giuen ouer of the Phiſitians, he made his confeſſion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the Bleſſed Sacrament, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired that in due time he might haue the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Extreme Vnctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. All which things done the third day of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:19779:34"/>December holding in his hands an Image of S. Ignatius which he had hanging about his necke, he called vpon him with a lowd voice, and with all his heart commended himſelfe vnto him, that he might obtaine his health; when vpon the ſodaine he began to be well, and was deliuered from his diſeaſe, hauing his ſtrength reſtored him againe in ſuch ſort, that the thirteenth day of the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, he made nine daies iourney fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Valladolid to Valentia, through cold and craggy mountaines in the very hart of winter.</p>
               <p>Theſe and multitudes of other mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles being daily ſeene and wrought throughout Europe, together with the Interceſſion of many Chriſtian Kings and Princes to the ſea Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like for further declaration of his Sanctity to the world, he was by Pope Paul V. beatified in the yeare of Chriſt 1613. and his feaſt kept ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne with great deuotion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of people to the Colledges of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:19779:35"/>the Society throughout Chriſtendo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me. And Pope Gregory the XV. being aſſumpted to the chaire of S.

King of France, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmond King of Polomia, the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dukes of Auſtria, Dukes of Bauaria, Sauoy, Florence, Parma, Mantua, and others, he was Canonized for a Saint in S.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>RANCIS Xauier was borne in that part of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre which belongeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Spaine, in the yeare of our Lord 1497. in the Caſtle of Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uier, of noble Parents, to wit, Iohn Iaſſe Preſident of the Kings Counſell of the ſame Prouince, and Mary Az<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilcueta, Lords of the towne of Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uier and other places ther about, who hauing piouſly brought him vp, and diligently inſtructed him in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chriſtian Doctrine, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was growne to ripenes of yeares, ſent him to Paris, that he might furnish
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:19779:36"/>himſelfe with learning in that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Vniuerſity. And afterwards when his father was about to ſend for him home, Mary Magdalen Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis his ſiſter, who then with great fame of ſanctity was Abbeſſe of the Monaſtery of the Reformed Nunns at Gandia, being by diuine reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> informed of her Fathers preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and the future glory of her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, wrote vnto her ſaid Father, that he should maintayne Francis ſtill at Paris in his ſtudies by all meanes poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, yea though he should be forced to ſpend all his reuenewes vpon him to that end: For that God Almighty had choſen him to be an Apoſtle of the new found world.</p>
               <p>Francis therfore at Paris comming to be acquainted with Ignatius Loyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la (who was afterwards founder of the Society of Ieſus) was with many prayers, and teares by the ſame Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, obtayned of our Lord to be his companion in procuring the glory of God. And being inſtructed by him in
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:19779:36"/>the ſpirituall Exerciſes, profited ſo well therby, that as one ſet on fire with the loue of Euangellicall perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and ſetting naught by all the honours and riches of the world, he couragiouſly vndertooke and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly followed, vnder the bauner of the ſame Ignatius, an auſtere and contemptible kinde of life, going a begging to get his victualls, giuing himſelfe to continuall prayer &amp; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of heauenly things, and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting his body with faſting and other workes of pennance.</p>
               <p>Departing from Paris he came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Italy, and whilſt he expected op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to go with his companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s into the Holy land, that they might labour there in conuerting the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, as they had made a vow to do, he in Venice, Bononia, and other Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, with rare example of ſanctity &amp; feruour of ſpirit, by preaching and doing other workes of charity, tooke wonderfull great paines in procuring the ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his neighbours: Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:19779:37"/>at Venice, where after he was made Prieſt, with great example of humility and charity he ſerued the ſicke in the Hoſpitall, being more ready and willing to aſſiſt and helpe thoſe, whoſe very ſight by reaſon of their vncurable diſeaſes and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome wounds, others were not able to abide, and that he might get a more glorious victory of himſelfe, he of tentimes drunke of the ſame water wherwith their ſores had bene waſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed.</p>
               <p>When there was no more hope of ſayling that yeare, he and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s as they had agreed before, came to Rome, that they might offer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the Pope, to be ſent whither he would for the ſpirituall good of their neighbours. And while they were leading there an auſtere life, very poore in whorldly commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but moſt rich in ſpirituall exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes and labours, taken for the glory of God, hauing newly laid the firſt foundations of the Society of Ieſus,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:19779:37"/>Iohn, King of Portugall, being very earneſtly bent to the conuerſion of the Eaſt Indies, made humble ſuit vnto Pope Paul the third, that he would ſend him ſome of Ignatius his companions who for learning and holines of life were by all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s report iudged fit for that voyage, that they might preach the Ghoſpel in thoſe moſt large and vaſt Prouinces.</p>
               <p>For this exploit, Ignatius by the Popes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion appointed Francis; who hauing receiued of the Pope the dignity and authority of Legate of the Sea Apoſtolike, as one now cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen by God for an Apoſtle according to his ſiſters Prophecy, tooke in hand his iourney without delay. And the ſignes and tokens of his Sanctity and Apoſtolicall feruour while he ſtaid in Portugall were ſuch, that by the generall voice of all, he was called the Apoſtle which name not only while he liued, but after he was dead alſo he euer kept ſtill. In ſo much that for his ſake throughout all Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:19779:38"/>Africke, Aſia, and the new found world, as far as the Portugalls dominions reach, all that are of the Society of Ieſus, are called Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>Out of Portugall he tooke ship for the Eaſt Indies, but could not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to take any thing to beare his charges, except only an old patcht cloake; and ſo begged his victuals in the ship, ſlept in the open ayre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the hatches, hauing a cable rope for his bed. He was alwayes ready to helpe the ſicke, not only begging of thoſe who had meate for ſuch as wanted, but with his owne hands alſo dreſſing and parting it amongſt them, thinking no ſcorne euen to wash their cloathes, or do any other ſeruice were it neuer ſo baſe, for them, in whoſe perſons this holy and prudent ſeruant of Chriſt, ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledged and reuerenced Chriſt himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Hauing ſpent all day in praying &amp; taking paines, he vnceſſantly wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched all night in comforting the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:19779:38"/>and adminiſtring the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to ſuch as were in danger of death. Whervpon ſome were wont to ſay, that the only thinge Francis tooke pleaſure in, next vnto prayer, was ſeruing of the ſicke. And this was euer his fashion and manner of liuing, not only in this, but alſo in all other voyages he made by ſea, where in he ſpent a great part of his life. Neither did this his charity towards poore and ſicke perſons shine only vpon the ſea, but alſo vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> land while he abode in Citties, the beames of the ſame charity neuer loſt one iot of their brightnes. Nay rather being now made all with all, that he might gaine and purchaſe the ſoules of all for God Almighty, to thoſe that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by reaſon of wealth or health, had no need of this kind of ſeruice, he was neuer wanting in other ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uioe, of no leſſe importance for them when occaſion was offered: neuer ſparing of labour which he was to beſtow in furthering the ſaluation of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:19779:39"/>his Neighbours.</p>
               <p>When he arriued at the Indies af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a long yeares ſea-faring he would graunt no time of reſt to his weather beaten body; but preſently began to fling about the fire which he came to caſt into thoſe Prouinces; going vp and downe the Citty, and calling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a litle bell into ſome Church or other, the children and people, there teaching them the Chriſtian Doctrine, with ſuch effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eacy of ſpirit, that it pierced euen to the bottome of their hearts, like vnto the Doctrine of the Apoſtles. He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded them all to ſing the prayers he taught them vp and downe the ſtreetes, and to teach their friends &amp; acquaintance the ſame at home. Which cuſtome by him brought into the Indies, to the great glory of God, remayneth and is obſerued there euen vntill this day.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that were come to yeares of diſcretion, by all gentle meanes poſſible, he inuited to confeſſion &amp;
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:19779:39"/>pennance, and neuer ceaſed with an vndaunted courage, and many times with euident danger of his life, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing into ſtrange and vncouth Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninces, &amp; that often times barefoote, with torne and beggailie apparell, to call heathens to the true liberty of the ſounes of God. In which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize Almighty God did ſpecially aſſiſt the indeauours of his ſeruant, confirming euery where what he preached with miracles, that were moſt notorious, and like to thoſe which the Apoſtles wrought, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly mouing the hearts of thoſe that heard him, in ſuch ſort, that he conuerted and baptized: many tho L<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandes, and drew many out of the puddle of ſinne, not without many and troubleſome iourneyes both by ſea and land. Many are the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, Prouinces and Ila<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds through which the Legate of Heauen and of the Roman Sea went ſowing the word of God. And at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth as he was ſeeking entrance for the Ghoſpell
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:19779:40"/>into the great Kingdome of China, this faithfull ſeruant, quite bruiſed &amp; broken with the intollerable paines, which beyond all humane force he had ſo long indured for the glory of God, and altogether worne out and conſumed with the heauenly &amp; bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning deſire he had to ſee Chriſt his Sauiour, being now at laſt, out of a deſert Ile named Sancianum, called home vnto his country of Heauen, &amp; to the marriage of the La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>be of God, entred into the ioy which our Lord had prepared for him, the ſecond day of Dece<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, in the yeare of our Lord 1552.</p>
               <p>The vertues of this holy Apoſtle are very many and moſt Heroicall, ſome wherof I shall heere recount. The daily profeſſion he made of his faith in receiuing of the Sacraments, himſelfe with wonderfull great deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and with no leſſe paines mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring the ſame to others; his heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call workes; his great and dangerous pilgrimages to preach the ſame faith
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:19779:40"/>to Barbarous and Sauage people, and that alone without any humane helpe at all, expreſſing and ſetting foorth ſo liuely in himſelfe, the purity and ſanctity of the Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gelicall Doctrine; finally the abundance of the fruit which he hath ſent out of thoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine countreies, into the granaries of the Catholike Church, to wit, ſo many millions of Chriſtians, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt whom ſo many glorious martyrs haue watered and fertilized the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church of thoſe Countre with their blood, and ſo many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours in the very middle of moſt cruel perſecutions haue defended the faith of Chriſt, are pregnant proofes of the excellency of that Euangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſeed of Faith, which he carried with him.</p>
               <p>Fiue things he had in him which cannot poſſibly conſiſt without a moſt firme and ſtedfaſt Hope. Firſt, a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt of all temporall things, moſt manifeſtly ſeene in his deſpiſing of all worldly honours, dignities and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:19779:41"/>which the world in all abonda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce did aſſure him of, and imbracing an humble kind of life in religious purity, vnder the yoke of obedience, and that in the very flowre of his youth. Secondly, his voluntary ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of exceſſiue trouble, labours &amp; miſeries, to the which by how much more grieuous they were, ſo much more willingly did he expoſe himſelfe, as it moſt plainly appeareth in the whole diſcourſe of his life. Thirdly, an vndaunted courage in attempting hard enterpriſes, putting his very life ſo ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in danger amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt ſtrange and barbarous people. As for example when alone he encountred a whole army of Badagars, which afterward I will rehearſe amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miracles. Fourthly a wonderfull great ſecurity in dangers, in ſo much that in the middeſt of cares he was without care, and without feare in the middeſt of feares, ship wrackes, enemies, and many other miſeries, hanging many times ouer his very
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:19779:41"/>head. Laſtly an incredible ioy in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſity, which may be euidently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by his continuall cheerfulnes of mind and readines of will, wherby glorying with the Apoſtle in the hope of the ſonnes of God, he ſuffered ſo many labours, and troubles, ſo many perills and aduerſities, liuing iuſtly &amp; holily in this world, and expecting the bleſſed hope and comming of Almighty God.</p>
               <p>For the loue of God, he moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly and perfectly kept all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements, daily meditating vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his ſacred Law with a pure conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and great horrour of neuer ſo little tranſgreſſing, or doing any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſame him ſelfe, and neuer without great care that others should likewiſe obſerue the ſame; wherin, as alſo in keeping his vowes of volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Pouerty, Chaſtity and Obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, he ſo excelled, that he did not only thereby ſtop the aduerſaries mouthes, but by the mouthes and tongues of all, not only of Chriſtians, but eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:19779:42"/>of Idolaters themſelues, he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called by no other name but Saint.</p>
               <p>For the ſame loue, had he ſo fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar and often conference euery day with God, wherby he was ſo ſet on fire, that many times with his face all inflamed, &amp; his eyes faſtened vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on heauen, he was miraculouſly ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uated, and raiſed vp from the ground: ſundry times as one not able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the abundance of his heauenly conſolations, he would cry out, <hi>Satis eſt Domine, ſatis eſt:</hi> It is inough O Lord, it is inough. He had Ieſus in heart ad mouth, both ſleepinge and waking. And ſo in ſleepe would he often call vpon him, <hi>Mi Ieſu, dulcis Ieſu</hi> and euen in the middle of whole multitudes of people, he would burſt foorth into Faculatory prayers, which greatly moued thoſe that heard him, to the loue of God.</p>
               <p>Moreouer this ſame Charity was that, which caſt away all feares of ſo many ship wrackes and dangers, in
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:19779:42"/>trauayling alone through ſtrange and deſert countries, &amp; dealing with the harsh, and ſauage humours and conditions of thoſe barbarous and rude Infidells. Finally his admirable Charity doth ſo shine in the conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt he had, not only of all worldly things but euen of death it ſelfe, that he might truly ſay with S. Paul: <hi>Quis nos ſeperabit à Charitate Chriſti? tribulatio? an anguſtia? an fames? an nuditas? an periculu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp;c. in his omnibus ſuperamus propter eum qui diligit nos.</hi> Who shall ſeparate vs from the loue of Chriſt? shall tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation? shall anguish? shall hunger? shall nakednes? danger &amp;c. in all theſe we get the vpper hand, for his ſake that loueth vs.</p>
               <p>Of his Charity towards his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, he gaue ſufficient teſtimony in all Hoſpitalls where he came, ſeruing of the ſicke, dreſſing theire meat with his owne hands, watching many times all night with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, aſſicting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at the houre of their death, washing their dead bodies and burying them,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:19779:43"/>were they neuer ſo loath ſome &amp; full of ſores. He was wont to part; not only all that he had himſelfe, but all that he could beg alſo from doore to doore of others, amongſt the poore, with ſuch feeling of loue, that he was not only called com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlv, <hi>the Father of the poore,</hi> but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny alſo would afirme, that Prayer and Poore men, were his only ioy &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</p>
               <p>He tooke very great compaſſion vpon priſoners, whome he often viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and comforted both with corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and ſpirituall ſood, pleading for them, and making ſuite for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuéry, as far as he could proceed with any shew of reaſon: and thus without eating any thing he would ſpend whole dayes, and feele no hunger, which he could not haue done without another ſpeciall meate which was to do the will of Chriſt, in workes of Charity towards his neighbour.</p>
               <p>He was daily teaching Children
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:19779:43"/>the principles of Chriſtian Doctrine, &amp; explicating the ſame more at large to ſuch as were of more capacity; he was alwaies calling ſinners to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and driuing away the darknes of errour and infidelity, with the light of the holy Ghoſpell. To conclude, in all things whatſoeuer he did or tooke in hand, he ſought nothing elſe but the ſaluation of ſoules, which he ſo tenderly loued, that he was ready to shed his blood for them, as is moſt apparent by the hard and dangerous enterpriſes he vndertooke for their ſakes.</p>
               <p>No time nor place, were they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo dangerous, no difficulties nor employments were they of neuer ſo great importance, could defraud him of his prayer. For whatſoeuer any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary worke of Charity tooke away from his ordinary houres of meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the day times, he would be ſure to make that nights reſt pay for it, in ſo much that many times, following the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of our Sauiour,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:19779:44"/>after whole dayes ſpent in grear toyle and trouble, from midnight vntill morning, <hi>pernoctabat in oratione Dei,</hi> he watched in meditation of heauenly things: thus ordinarily in ſome garde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if the night were cleare and the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament all adorned, with glittering ſtars, by meanes of ſo beautifull creatures, he would ſtand wholy ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uished with the beauty of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour.</p>
               <p>The flashing flames and brightnes which haue bene ſeene in his face while he prayed, did not only euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shew the efficacy of that fier of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion within his owne breſt, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled alſo a new fire of deuotion &amp; loue of God in the hearts of them that faw it. Now what tongue of mortall man is able to expreſſe the ſweetnes and iubily of heart which in prayer, his mortall heart being vnable to beare, he was often heard to ſay: <hi>Non plus Domine, ſatis eſt</hi> No more, o Lord, it is inough. And once in Maſſe he was ſo raptin extaſy, that he could
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:19779:44"/>not feele him that ſerued him now and then to pull him by his veſtme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, nor for the ſpace of an houre returne vnto his ſenſes.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding all this, he eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med himſelfe the greateſt ſinner in the world, &amp; inferiour vnto all, there was nothing ſo baſe, that he thought not good inough for himſelfe; no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ſo ſmall, that he deemed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe worthy of, ſo that he deſired to haue commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ouer none, but to be ſubiect vnder all, and therfore did he reuerence all as if they had bene his Superiours.</p>
               <p>All ambition he troad vnder foote, blushing no leſſe when he was pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, then others are wont to do when they are diſprayſed; and whenſoeuer he did miracles, or any thing elſe that might redound to his prayſe or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, he did what he could to put it off, by attributing what was done to the merits and interceſſion of his companions, or other people then preſent.</p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:19779:45"/>
               <p>He kept the great authority which the Pope had giuen him ſo cloſe, that for the ſpace of ten yeares, none but only the Bishop of Goa knew that he was the Popes Legate; neither did he euer vſe the ſame but only once, and that not without the aduiſe of the ſaid Bishop, when he had no other meanes at all left to maintayne the glory of God.</p>
               <p>In shippes and hoſpitalls he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes made choice (as we haue ſeene before) of the baſeſt offices. He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes bore great reſpect and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, to Bishoppes, Prieſts, and all other Superiours: in ſo much that he neuer wrote letter to S. Ignatius his Generall, but vpon his knees.</p>
               <p>Out of this Humility did he chooſe rather a beggers weede, then a noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans robe, finding more content in the groſſe fare he had by begging of others, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the dainty dishes which he might haue had of his owne; and ſo he euer refuſed the rich apparell that euery where was offered him;
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:19779:45"/>But whatſoeuer dainty dish he got by begging or otherwayes, he parted it amongſt the poore.</p>
               <p>In his chamber he had nothing but a few neceſſary bookes, &amp; a bed, with a courſe couerler, and two hard bolſters, more fit to driue a way, then any way to procure ſleepe.</p>
               <p>In all his many and long pilgrima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges a ſtaffe alwayes was his horſe, and all his prouiſion depended vpon the liberality of the countrey which he trauayled along. But if he were to goe through any long deſert, where no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> liued, he would be ſure to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide the pooreſt victualls he could, and ſo in all that long and deſolate iourney which he made to Mexico, he eat nothing elſe but dried Rice. As for his apparell it was ſuch as made the boyes laugh at him as he trauay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led along the ſtreetes. Finally as he would eat nothing but what he beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, ſo would he take vp no lodging but in publike Hoſpitalls with beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:19779:46"/>
               <p>Beſides all that hath bene ſaid, he would neuer drinke wine, nor eat flesh, or bread made of wheat; faſting many times without eating any thing at all for two, or three, or fowre dayes together, and ſometimes from Paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſunday to Eaſter Eue. He did very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten chaſtiſe his body by sharp diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines platted with wire, till he had fercht out great ſtore of blood. Once in the beginning of his conuerſion he went ſo long with his armes and thighes ſtrait bound, that the cordes hauing buried themſelues within his flesh, the Phiſitians and Chirurgions iudged him to be vncurable, and that he could neuer haue eſcaped death, if the ropes had not bene miraculouſly broken. He was contented with two or three houres ſleepe, imploying all the reſt of the night in praying, and viſiting of the ſicke.</p>
               <p>Thus he ouercame the world in wholy vanquishing of himſelfe and all his ſenſuall appetites, with ſuch weapons as you haue ſeene, and that
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:19779:46"/>which ſtout ſtomackes would ſearce abide to heare of, I meane his drinking of the water wherwith he had washed ſick mens ſores and bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
               <p>From the yeare of our Lord 1541. when he ſailed into the Indies, vnto the yeare 1552. when he died, he liued in conunuall trauayles amongſt ſtrange and barbarous people, often enduring intolerable heat, cold, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, hunger and thirſt for long time together, going many dayes iourneis amongſt thorues and briars, almoſt euery where entertayned with ſcoffes and reproches, nay and in ſome places, with ſtripes and ſtones, for which with a merry and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full heart he gaue thankes to God, humbly asking pardon for his perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutours.</p>
               <p>As ſoone as he came into any of thoſe ſtrange countries, which were many and diuers where he preached the Ghoſpell, he ſpoke the language of the ſame Nation, were it neuer ſo
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:19779:47"/>different from the reſt, as elegantly and readily as if he had bene borne and brought vp in the ſame coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and diuers times it happened, that men of diuers nations heard e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one their owne tongue in one Sermon. Worthy therfore, and thrice worthy of that moſt renowned title of Apoſtle, which the people both of Spaine and India do giue as due vnto him, ſeeing that Chriſt himſelfe ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to confirme the ſame, not only by the prophecy of Xauerius his owne ſiſter, but by that ſpeciall gift alſo which his Apoſtles had to preach his holy Ghoſpell.</p>
               <p>Amongſt many examples of this rare gift which may be ſeene in the Relation aboue written, ſince the breuity of this ſumme will not admit all, I haue made choice of one no leſſe pleaſant then profitable.</p>
               <p>It happened that Xauerius vpon a time comming to Peter Vellius a wealthy man then liuing in a Citty called Machai, as he was playing at
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:19779:47"/>Cheſſe in one of his neighbours houſes, asked an almes of him for ſome ſpeciall worke of charity. Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius at the firſt word gaue him his key and bad him go &amp; take as much as he would Xauerius went &amp; tooke three hundred Crownes, &amp; brought the key back againe to Vellius, who as ſoone as he canoe home, opening the cheſt fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d all his mony as he had left it, and wondering at the ſame, the next time he met Xauerius, asked him how much money he had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Xauerius anſwered, that he had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> three hundred Crownes. To which Vellius replied, that he found all his money entire as he left it; and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer he added that he deliuered him his key, to the intent he might haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the one halfe of the thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand crownes that were in the cheſt. Which Xauerius hearing, I therfore (ſaid he) in the name of God do giue my word vnto thee Vellius, that thou shalt neuer want, but God shall alwayes ſend thee whatſoeuer thou
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:19779:48"/>shalt haue need of, &amp; all men shalbe liberall and bountifull towards thee; nay and which is more, the laſt day of thy life shalbe reuealed vnto thee. And ſo indeed all fell out iuſt as Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerius had foretold. For albeit Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius afterwardes had many great mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes which might haue brought him to extreme pouerty, yet all men dealt ſtill ſo liberally with him, that he neuer wanted any thing neither for himſelfe, nor for his family as lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as he liued.</p>
               <p>To conclude, at length when ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares were paſt Vellius, being by reuelation forewarned of his death, after he had giuen a great deale of his wealth vnto the poore, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided a Maſſe to be ſong for his ſoule, bidding his friends farewell, he told them all the propheſy of Xauerius &amp; the euent therof. His friends thought that the old man began to dote. But he hauing heard almoſt all the Maſſe ſolemnely ſung for the dead, made no more a doe, but went &amp; laid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:19779:48"/>along vpon his beere, and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all ouer with a veyle, there waited for death. When Maſſe was done, and the Prieſt had ſaid, <hi>Requieſcant in pace,</hi> his ſeruants ran vnto him to take the veyle off him, ſuppoſing that he was yet aliue; but he had already yeelded vp the Ghoſt, and rendred his ſoule into the hands of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour.</p>
               <p>As the Badagars (a furious genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of people) were comming in great haſt ouer the toppes of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, with an huge army to deſtroy thoſe Chriſtians which Xauerius had baptized in the Kingdome of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancor, and about the Promontory of Comorinum, Xauerius all alone armed with the buckler of an muin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible confidence in Almighty God, went to meete them, and comming vnto them began to rebuke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> very ſeuerely, when vpon a ſodayne the whole army ſtood ſtill and was not able to goe forwards any further. In ſo much that all their Captaines cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:19779:49"/>vpon them, and exhorting them to march on, nothing preuayled with them, for they plainly anſwered, that they could no longer abide the heat that ſparkled out of the eyes, and face of a certaine great man of a terrible Maieſty I in blacke that ſtood ouer againſt them with Xauerius. Which the Captaines themſelues ſoone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by their owne experience fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding o be true, made a retrait to be ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, and ſo all the army returned, and Xauerius hauing wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  </gap>e the feild, deliueted from all danger his louing children which he had brought forth in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Another time as he was trauailing on the Mountaines of Comorinum, there came vnto him a poore Beggar ſo full of fores and vlcers, that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was ſcarce able to behould the loath ſomnes thereof. Xauerius with great charity and humility, washed his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, and to get greater victory ouer himſelfe, drunke vp the water wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he had washed them: And then
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:19779:49"/>kneeling downe vpon the ground, he feruently prayed vnto God for the health of the poore man, who was preſently deliuered and freed wholy from all his infirmities.</p>
               <p>Againe, at another time alſo, as Xauerius ſayled from Ambionum (a Citty in the Ilands of Moluca) vnto the Iland of Baranula, there aroſe vpon the ſuddaine a cruell Tempeſt; for the deaſing wherof, he tooke fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his neck a little Crucifixe about a fingars length, and held it in his hand in the water for a good ſpace, praying vnto our Lord for the ceaſing of the tempeſt. The ship beinge toſſed to and fro with the waues, by chance he let it fall from him into the ſea, for which he was very penſiue, &amp; shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed great ſignes of ſorrow. The day following, they all ariued ſafe at the for ſaid Iland whither they were to ſayle, where Xauerius going a land, with his Companion a long the ſea shore towards the towne of Tama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum, behould, a great ſea-Crabbe
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:19779:50"/>leapt from out the ſea to land, carring the ſaid Crucifix vpright and on high betweene her Finnes, and made haſt to Xauerius; who ſeing the wonder, fell downe on his knees, and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently tooke the Crucifix from her, and then proſently without more adoe the fish returned into the ſea. Xauerius hauing receaued the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifix, kiſſed the ſame deuoutly and with his armes a croſſe for halfe an houre, lay proſtrate vpon the ground in prayer with his Companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, giuing God thanks for ſo wonderfull a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle.</p>
               <p>Many more and ſtrange were the miracles which God wrought by Xauerius his interceſſion in his life time; as when with the ſigne of the croſſe, he turned the ſalt water of the ſea into ſweet, when he cured the blinde, raiſed three bodies fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death to life, wherof one had laine a whole day buried in his graue, and the like, as may be ſeene at large in the ſaid Relation.</p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:19779:50"/>
               <p>All which together with his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent vertues aboue touched, did ſo fill the moſt wide &amp; large Prouinces both of Eaſt and Weſt, with the great fame of his admirable ſanctity, that euen while he was yet aliue he was called by no other name but Saint, both by Chriſtians and Infidells, all euer calling vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, though he were abſent, in all their dangers and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
               <p>As ſoone as he was dead, his body was put into a coffin full of pure lime, and ſo buried vnder ground, that the flesh being conſumed, his bones might the ſooner be carried into the Indies; But foure monethes after, they found both his cloathes and his body as fresh and free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all corruption, as if they had bene then newly put into the coffin, and yielding more ouer a moſt ſweet and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable ſmell vnto all that were preſent.</p>
               <p>Wherfore putting it againe into the ſame Coffin with fresh lime they
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:19779:51"/>brought it vnto Malaca, at the very firſt entrance whereof into the Citty, a great plague which Xauerius had foretold, and had long afflicted the ſame, wholy ceaſed; and there like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe finding it yet entire and ſweet, they made a new coffin, and by thruſting in the body (for they made it too little) bloud iſſued out of his shoulders, and ſo they buried him only with earth in a Church of our B. Ladie; where alſo nine monethes after his death being found as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and with the veyle that couered his face all imbrued in fresh bloud, they made him a rich and ſumptuous Coffin, wherin being carried into the Indies he was ſolemnely receiued in the Citty of Goa, with great Po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe both of the Viceroy him ſelfe, and of all the Clergy &amp; people, who flocked thither from all parts to ſee and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence his ſacred body, which after many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ialls found ſtill to remayne vncorrupted, and that without balme or an yother pretious ointments, was
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:19779:51"/>placed at laſt in a ſepulcher made of purpoſe, at the right ſide of the high altar in the church of the Society in the ſame Citty.</p>
               <p>Vnto which as alſo vnto other Churches in which his Images are ſet vp to be piouſly reuerenced, all as well heathens as Chriſtians doe make great pilgrimages, obtayning ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of God no ſmall fauours by his interceſſion. For by this meanes the blind recouer ſight, the leproſy and other diſeaſes are cured, the dead raiſed to life, and many other ſuch like wonders wrought. Nay which is more, and very wonderfull, there was a woman called Lucy de Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanzan, who being an hundred and twenty yeares of age, and had bene baptized by Xauerius, after his death got a Meddall made at Coccinum, wheron was engrauen his picture: &amp; for the great deuotion she had to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſaid Bleſſed Father, for twelue yeares together she vſed to touch ſicke and diſeaſed people ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,

               <p>So great is the reſpect which the very Infidells themſelues beare to Xauerius, that although they haue deſtroyed a dozen Churches within the Coaſt of Trauancor, neere to the Promo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tary of Comorinum, yet they would neuer touch, or once meddle with the Church of Cottara, ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding amongſt the reſt, which for hauing in it the Image of Xauerius, they great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honour, calling it the Church of the great Father.

               <p>Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was ſixteene yeares of age and ſomewhat more, his Father ſent him into Campania to his Vncle Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus, liuing there in the towne of S. Germans, at the foote of Mount Caſſine, who was a very wellthy ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and had no children, and who had
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:19779:54"/>ſent for Philip his nephew vnto Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, to the end to make him his Heyre. But after he had ſtayed there a few dayes, fearing to be entangled with the world, he left his vncle, and all other friends, and came to Rome in the yeare 1533.</p>
               <p>When he was come to the Citty, he went vnto the houſe of one Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leot, who was a Cittizen of Flore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, with whome he liued diuers yeares, in great ſanctity, leading an auſtere life, contenting himſelfe with bread and water once a day, and oftentimes he paſſed three whole dayes, without eating any thing at all, delighting himſelfe only with meditation of heauenly things, in the very youth &amp; flowre of his age, wherein he ſpent whole dayes and nightes. And that he might be the better able to helpe others afterward in ſpirituall matters he freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted the ſchooles, and heard Philoſophy, profiting ſo well therein, that he became equall to any of his fellowes, ſtill retayning the innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:19779:54"/>of his childhood, euen in that age of his, and amongſt ſo many diſſolute ſtudents, as then he muſt needs be conuerſant withall.</p>
               <p>When he had now ended his Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, and alſo a good part of his Diuinity, he began to bid adue vnto the world, &amp; thought ſeriouſly how he might beſt imploy himſelfe, in the honour of God and ſeruice of his neighbours. Wherfore he betooke himſelfe, vnto the Hoſpitalls, where he comforted the ficke, ſerued them with his owne handes, aſſiſted them in any thing he could, teaching and inſtructing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> how to make a good Confeſſion, and to die happily if it should pleaſe God to call them. He had alwayes a ſpeciall care, neuer to come acquainted or be familiar with wicked perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. He exhorted as many as he ſaw had good partes, to enter into Religion, and in this point he happily preuailed with a great nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, who by his perſuaſion daily renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the world and became Riligious:
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:19779:55"/>In ſo much that S. Ignatius of Loyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, who then liued in Rome, and had newly inſtituted the Socity of Ieſus, and with whomthis holy man was greatly acquainted and conuerſant, was wont to call him the Bell, for that by his good ſound and pious voyce, he called ſo many to holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. And thus labouring on all ſides to gaine ſoules to God, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a moſt liuely example of Piety and Deuotion, vnto all, euen whiles he was yet a lay man.</p>
               <p>In the yeare of Chriſt 1551. He tooke vpon him holy Orders, &amp; was made Prieſt by commandement of his Ghoſtly Father. In ſaying of his Maſſe he was ſo rapt oftentimes, that he was ſeene to remayne in the ayre 2 foote aboue the ground, and was ſmetimes ſo take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in extaſy, through the extreme loue and admitation of that Diuine miſtery, that he knewe not where he was. His hart was alſo ſo inflamed with the lolue of the Holy Ghoſt, that often times in the very
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:19779:55"/>depth of winter, and in the greateſt cold weather, he was forced to apply outwardly ſome cooling and refrige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue thinge vnto his breſt.</p>
               <p>It happened on a time, that by his reading certaine Epiſtles of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, In which he tooke great delight, he was ſo mooued with compaſſion towards the Infidels of thoſe vaſt and remote Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>treyes, for that they were not members of Gods Church; that he reſolued to goe thither in perſon, with twenty others of his diſciples, to preach and teach the faith of Chriſt vnto them, for their Conuerſion. But this buſines, as all other of moment, he firſt commended ſeriouſly to God in his daily prayers and meditations, crauing his aſſiſtance, direction, and declaration of his holy will therein. At le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth our Lord put into his mind, that concerning this great affaire, he should goe and conſult, and take his direction fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a Monke of S. Bernards Order, who then liued in the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of S. Vincentius and Anaſtaſius
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:19779:56"/>in Rome, a greet ſeruant of God, and much reuerenced for the holines of his life. To him S. Philip preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payred, and expounded vnto him his whole intention and deſire: who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently demaunded ſome reſpite to anſwere, him, ſaying that this buſines was to be ſought from God for anſwere, by earneſt prayer, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to know his will: wherfore ioyning both their prayers together, after ſome houres of recollection, the Holy Monke told him, that he was not to goe to the Indies (for that work (was to be done by another) but to remayne ſtill in Rome, &amp; that Rome muſt be the Indies, and the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyard which God would haue him to manure and cultiuate: Adding fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that S. Iohn the Euangeliſt had appeared vnto him, and tould him ſo: and that he should gather together many Diſciples in Rome, whoſe workes should be very profitable to that Citty.</p>
               <p>With this anſwere S. Philip was
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:19779:56"/>fully ſatisfied of the will of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that buſines, and therfore now began to apply himſelfe to the helpe of his neighbours, by teacing, preaching, reading of Saints liues, hearing Confeſſions, and the like; ſo that in short time, he had many fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, and worthy Diſciples (amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt which Caeſar Baronius, afterward Cardinall, that famous Hiſtoriogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher was one (with whom he laid the foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his order, beginning by little &amp; little, &amp; calling the people to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether into the Church with a bell at certaine houres of the day; wherein after halfe an houre of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall prayer ſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which euery one made to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe (yet altogether in one place) there were recited publikely te leta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and other prayers, commending therin as well the publike, as the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate affaires of the holy Church. This order was obſerued on Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes, Tueſdayes, Thurſdayes, and Saturdayes. The other three dayes of the weeke, to wit, Munday, Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:19779:57"/>day, and Friday, when they met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, thy made a diſcipline whiles the 50. pſalme and the Anthymne of <hi>Salue Regina</hi> (or ſome other Pſalme or Hymne) was reading hauing expoſed before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only the Image of Chriſt crucified, placed in ſuch order in a lanterne, that all the Confraternity might behould the ſame at once in the darke. Which cuſtome weekely obſerued, doth yet remayne in the ſaid Congregation, with great deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and fruite of ſpirituall profit.</p>
               <p>This was the firſt beginning and foundation of the Congregation, of the Oratory which was erected in S. Hieromes Church in Rome, ſurna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>de Charitate.</hi> And after a few yeares the ſame was brought into vſe in the Church of S. Iohn Baptiſt alſo in Rome, belonging to the Flore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tines, at the requeſt and interceſſion of the Cittizens of Florence, and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned, vntill S. Philip founded a new Church and houſe, of his owne, at our Bleſſed Ladies in Vallicella
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:19779:57"/>commonly called the <hi>Chieſa nuoua,</hi> where himſelfe liued vntill his dying day: And now is greatly in creaſed &amp; ſpread ouer all Italy, France, Spayne, Germany, &amp; other Prouinces, to the great aduancement of Piety &amp; Deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the faithfull.</p>
               <p>His predictions, propheſies, and foreknowledge of ſecret thinges (being far abſent) are wonderfull in him both aliue and dead, and to ſet downe an example or two in this place, it will not be amiſſe. It happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vpon a time that Cardinall Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, being then a Diſciple of the Bleſſed Father and a layman, came vnto him one euening to Confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The Father as ſoone as he ſaw him ſaid, Goe Caeſar, goe preſently to the Hoſpitall of <hi>S. Spiritus,</hi> and helpe the ſicke, I will heare thy Confeſſion af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward. Baronius was at this ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what troubled being now prepared for his Confeſſion, and replied, that the time of ſeruing the ſicke was now paſt, and that he should looſe his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:19779:58"/>in going thither, as comming at an vnſeaſonable houre, when there was nothing to doe. Doe as I bid thee, ſaid the holy Father without more adoe. Baronius being ready to obay, went preſently to the Hoſpitall, and when he came to the entrance of the roome where the ſicke lay, he began to reaſon with himſelfe, ſaying; Sure, there is ſome miſtery in this matter, that our Father commaunds me to come hither at this vnſeaſonable houre (for it was now euen night &amp; time of reſt) and whiles he was thus reaſoning with himſelfe, he eſpied a ſick man, with a candle ſtanding lighted at his head, ready to giue vp the Ghoſt, to whom he preſently went, and began to comfort with words of conſolation, demaunding whether he had confeſſed his ſinnes, and receaued the Sacraments of the holy Church: who being hardly able to draw his breath, anſweree noe. Then Baronius preſently ran to the Chaplaine of the Hoſpitall, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:19779:58"/>him to come quickly &amp; heare his Confeſſion. The Chaplaine ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ashamed of his owne negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, began to excuſe it, and came with him inſtantly to the ſicke man, who made his Confeſſion, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently receaued the holy Sacrament of the Altar, and Extreme Vnction, and ſo ſtraight after departed happily this life. Baronius returned home, &amp; came vnto the Father and related the whole ſtory. Why ſo quoth the holy Father, hence forward learne to obey more readily, and doe what thou art commaunded.</p>
               <p>After that Baronius was made Prieſt, and had a long time preached vnto the people at S. Iohn Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines Church aforeſaid, who was alſo ſuperiour of the Congregation of that houſe, he was exempted from his Office, and commanded by the holy Father to write the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Hiſtory of the Church, which after many difficulties propoſed to the ſaid Father, he obeyed his voyce,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:19779:59"/>and began the ſame, and afterward very happily deduced it to the 13. hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeare after Chriſt, as may be ſeene by his twelue Tomes extant euery where.</p>
               <p>Another time it happened, that the Parents of a yong Gentleman, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to promote their ſone, cauſed him to be made Prieſt at the age of 17. yeares, by reaſon that there was a great inheritance fallen vnto the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Heyre of that family, which yet could not be poſſeſſed by him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he were a Prieſt: So his Parents concealing his age both from the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, and the young man himſelfe, and all others, he was made Prieſt &amp; tooke poſſeſſion of the Inheritance. Preſently after it chanced that Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas (ſo he was called) came to Rome, and hearing of the great fame of S. Philip Nerius, he was brought vnto him to ſalute him. So ſoone as the holy man ſaw him, he ſaid. You are a Prieſt Syr: is it not ſo? Yea, quoth the other, I am without doubt, by the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:19779:59"/>grace of God. You ſay true, ſaid Saint Philip: and then he could him his age truly, and how all had happened, by his friends meanes, and for what cauſe, neuer ſeeing knowing or hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the man before that houre. Afterward S. Philip was demaunded of thoſe that ſtood by, &amp; heard theſe thinges, how he knew, that the was a Prieſt? He ſaid, that he did ſee the face of the yonge man to shine in the ſame manner, that all others who be ſigned with the Character of true Prieſthood, do vſe to doe.</p>
               <p>It happened alſo that a noble Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man yong youth, who was giuen greatly to the pleaſures of the world, was by another like youth and friend of his who was very deuout, brought vnto S. Philip vnder colour to ſee and ſalute him. When he came, his friend could the holy Father, that he had brought vnto him a Penitent. The Noble yonge man began to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, thinking that the other had mocked him, for that he had noe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:19779:60"/>of Confeſſion; Yet in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of S. Philip, for feare and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of his perſon, hee aſſwaged his choler. And preſently kneeled downe vnto him, ſaying that he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, and ſo began: but with inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to deceaue the Father by not confeſſing his ſinnes truly as he should. The Father by diuine reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion knew his intention, and ſo let him make an end. When he ſeemed to haue done, the Father exhorted him, that if he had committed any other ſinnes, he should confeſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The other replied, and ſaid, that he had confeſſed all. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> S. Philip ſtood vp, and imbraching him ſaid: You ſay not true, my So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, for you haue made but a faigned Confeſſion of your ſinnes. Now therfore I aduiſe you in the name of God, that you confeſſe them wholy, that you may be made worthy of pardon and forgiuenes. Which words ſo pierced the hart of the noble yong man, that repeating againe his Confeſſion, he made it
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:19779:60"/>wholy and perfect of all his ſinnes, euen from his childhood: and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted himſelfe to be wholy gouerned and directed for the reſt of his life to the holy Father Who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited ſo well in ſpirit vnder ſo great a Maiſter, that within a while after he became a Religious man, and entred into the order of Saint Francis, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he happily continued and made a holy end. His name was Raphael Lupus.</p>
               <p>The miracles which it pleaſed God to worke of his ſeruant both aliue &amp; dead, are almoſt innumerable. In the yeare of Chriſt 1552. one Mauritius Anerius, a Roman, fell dangerouſly ſick, who being forſaken of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, as deſperate, prepared himſelfe to die, and had now receaued the holy Sacraments of the Altar, and Extreme Vnction, expecting a happy houre. Saint Philip hearing thereof, went in the euening to viſit him, who found his wife and kinsfolkes wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, bewayling the loſſe of ſo deare a
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:19779:61"/>friend. The holy Father exhorted all preſent to kneele downe with him, &amp; implore the helpe of the B. Virgin for the ſicke man, preſently they did as he willed, and he in the meane ſpace laid his hands vpon his head; which done, he went his way out of the houſe, the others either not ſeeing him to depart, orels not marking the ſame, being all full of griefe and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. But ſee a wonder; he was ſcarſe gone, but the ſicke man began to ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his eyes, looke about him, and talke as ready and ſenſibly as euer he did in his health, ſaying he was well, and would needes riſe out of his hed, ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding forth praiſes to God, and extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the holines of S. Philip, by whoſe helpe and aſſiſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce he had recouered his health; &amp; he liued after this, vntill the yeare of our Lord 1593. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually prayſing God and the How Father for the miracle.</p>
               <p>The like happened vnto one Peter Victricius a Cittizen of Parma in the yeare of Chriſt 1566. who liuing then
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:19779:61"/>in Rome, fell into a dangerous ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, which ſo increaſed, that the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirians gaue him ouer for a dead ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. In this meane time came the holy Father vnto him to comfort, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt him for his laſt paſſage, who hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his hands ouer him, and praying earneſtly to God for his health, he preſently felt himſelfe better, and within a dayor two, became perfectly well, extolling and prayſing the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity of S. Philip.</p>
               <p>The ſame yeare Iohn Baptiſta Creſcius, a yong man of Rome, had ſuch an intollerable paine in his eyes, by reaſon of a burning water which ran from them, that he could neither endure the light, or the ayre, or take any reſt or repoſe for many dayes, wherby he was in danger of his life, the Phiſitians determined to make him an iſſue in his necke, but he not willing to haue it, deſired an vncle of his to lead him to the holy Father Philip, which he did, deſiring him, that it would pleaſe him to pray to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:19779:62"/>God for his Nephew that he might recouer the health of his eyes. The holy man preſently touched his eyes with his hands, making the ſigne of the Croſſe vpon them and ſaid. Thou shalt my Sonne, by Gods helpe, recouer thy eyes; &amp; preſently he began to open them, &amp; ſee perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly, &amp; could endure the light, which before he could not, and ſo within two or three dayes he became per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly well, without applying any thing at all thereunto.</p>
               <p>In the yeare 1569. Laure<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tius Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianus, a yong man, and a Clerke of S. Peters Church, fell into a burning feuer, which was ſo vehement, that in few dayes he was pronounced for dead by the Phiſitians. Wherfore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing made his Confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; receaued deuoutly the holy Euchariſt and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Extreme. Vnction, hauing wholy loſt his ſenſes, he expected the happy houre of his departure. The holy Father came to viſit him about one a Clocke in the night, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing asked of the ſtanders by, how he
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:19779:62"/>did, &amp; vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding that he was paſt hope of recouery, kneeled downe by his bed ſide, and prayed a good while for his health. And then riſing he ſaid: Laurence shall not die of this ſicknes, and drawing neere vnto him, laying his hands vpon his head, he called vpon him by his name with a very loud voyce. Wherwith the man that was now ready to giue vp the ghoſt, was awaked, &amp; began to ſtart, and opening his eyes, after a little pauſe called for meate, eate well, and within a few houres aroſe whole &amp; ſafe from his bed, prayſing God, and extolling the holy Father. In the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Phiſitian was called; and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his pulſe, found him perfectly cured ſaying. O Laurence, a greater Phiſitia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my ſelfe hath cured thee; thou haſt not bene holpen by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, but by diuine ayde.</p>
               <p>In the yeare of our Lord 1570. there came to Rome from Atella, a certaine Gentle woman, who was grieuouſly poſſeſſed by the diuell, and though
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:19779:63"/>she were wholy vnlearned, yet did she ſpeake latin, and that very ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly; and being alſo asked any thing in latin, she would alſo anſwere in the ſame tongue, to the aſtonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all that heard her. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer she was ſo ſtrong, that foure lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty men could ſcarce take her from the ground and lift her vp, although she ſeemed in outward shew, to be a very weake and tender woman. She was brought vnto S. Philip, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to exorcize her, after a ſtrang manner yet in ſuch ſort that he made the diuell within a while to forſake her: and this was, that he beate her very ſorely with little iron chaines. And though the Diuell cried out a loud, ſaying, come beate me, ſtrike me, kill me, and the like, yet did the woman not ſo much as once ſtir or moue her body all the while, but ſtood ſtill like a ſtatua of ſtone or wood. Which the holy man percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, left her for that time, &amp; cauſed her body to be refreshed with food.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:19779:63"/>Vpon this she became ſo fearfull of S. Philip, that when she did but ſee any one to come towards her, she ſuſpected they would carry her to him to be againe exorcized, which alwayes they were forced to doe with foure ſtrong me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. S. Philip euery day cauſed her to be thus beaten, together with other exorciſmes that he vſed, till he forced the Diuell to depart out of her body, who the night after he was caſt out, came to the holy Father in his cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, and with threatning eyes burſt forth into theſe words: You Sirra, you good fellow, you haue vſed your pleaſure vpon me to day, but I will not forget the iniury: and ſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished away, and the Gentle woman remayned alwayes free afterward to her dying day.</p>
               <p>Whiles the fame of this holy man was ſpread ouer the Citty, for his many miracles, and other notable things by him done, he had many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and malignant aduerſaries, who enuying his workes of piety, began to
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:19779:64"/>ſpread abroad ſome falſities of the man and his life. Some accuſed him that he drew many noble yong you<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes from the world, and shut them vp in Cloiſters; Others accuſed him of ſimplicity and rudenes; Others, that in his ſermons &amp; exhortations he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpake many ridiculous thinges, or els did fayle in explicatinge the Doctrine of the Church aright. Theſe thinges at laſt came vnto the eares of <hi>Pius Quintus,</hi> the Pope, who being a wiſe Paſtour of his flocke, did not ſo eaſily belieue euery thing that was ſaid: But ſending for two Dominican Friars, that were very learned, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded them to goe euery day vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, to heare the Sermons and Exerciſes which S. Philip made, and to relate vnto him truly how the matter went. They did accordingly, and being one of them preſent euery day, for a long time, they neuer found the leaſt fault, nor cauſe of complaint, but contrary wiſe found him to ſpeak with ſuch force, efficacy and feruour
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:19779:64"/>of ſpirit, that he moued all the Andi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, of what matter ſoeuer he ſpake. Nay which is more, when either he handled any high point or miſtery of faith himſelfe in his Sermons, or when in other Exerciſe of the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, he was asked by any, he did explicate the ſame ſo cleerely and perſpicuouſly, as any learned Diuine could haue done in the ſcooles, to the admiration and wonder of the two learned Fathers, that were ſet to marke and obſerue him: ſo as his aduerſaries inuentions vanished into the ayre.</p>
               <p>Another time he was called before the Gouernour of Rome (who is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ordinarily an Eccleſiaſticall man) &amp; accuſed of making a tumult and vprore in the Citty, for that at a shrouetyde he had gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a great number of pilgrims and others of the poorer ſort, and ſome alſo of good fashion, and by his good exhortation and counſell, had perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to viſit the ſeauen Churches
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:19779:65"/>on Shroue tweſday at what tyme or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily there are more diſorders committed in the Citty then at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: and he himſelfe going before them and they following two &amp; two in a ranke, went ſinging one while the letanies, another while hymnes, pſalmes, and other deuotions, to the great profit of their owne ſowles, and edification of the behoulders. When the Gouernour had heard the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints generall, and beleeued his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries, that their accuſations were true, he preſently ſent for the Father, and sharply reprehended him, for his gathering together of people in that tumultuous ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner as he was accuſed to haue done, threatning to ſend him to priſon if he did not deſiſt. S. Philip did not goe about to excuſe himſelfe, but anſwered humbly and lowly, that he was ready as well to proceed in the worke he had begun, as to deſiſt from the ſame if Superiours did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, and that he neither ſought or aymed at any thing, then the glory of God and good of ſoules. At which
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:19779:65"/>meeke anſwere, the Gouernour was yet ſo angry, that he commaunded him to appeare before him as often as he should be called; that he should not heare any ones Confeſſion for fifteene days ſpace; that he should preach no more at all without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe leaue graunted him a new; and laſtly after many co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tumelious words thruſt him out of dores.</p>
               <p>All theſe things S. Philip bare very patiently, and with ſo conſtant and merry a countenance, that he was not perceaued to be at all moued therwith. In the meane while now that his aduerſaries triumphing, had thought to haue ſo preuayled againſt him, he inceſſantly prayed vnto God for ayde, and not in vaine. For within the preſcribed time, the Gouernour hauing made more enquiry of the man, and of his manner of life, and reflecting vpon the humble anſwere he had made him, to wit, <hi>That he was ready either to proſecute the worke he had begon, or to leaue it when Superiours should
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:19779:66"/>pleaſe,</hi> found that he was iniured and brought into theſe ſuſpitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of meere hatred and calumniation. Wherfore he ſent for the holy Father, and gaue him free leaue to liue as he pleaſed, to heare Confeſſions, teach, preach, as before, with ſignes of ſorrow, that he had bene abuſed. And for that ſome others, who were alſo of high authority, were aduerſe to S. Philip in this buſines, and would not haue had him to be ſo quit, they died ſod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, before the foreſaid fifteene dayes were expired.</p>
               <p>After that the holy man had ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red theſe and many ſuch other brunts of calumniation and emnity, and had alwayes gotten the victory by his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience &amp; modeſt behauiour; he ſetled himſelfe ſeriouſly to erect and found a houſe of his owne, which he did at our B. Ladies in Vallicella, in the yeare of our Lord 1576. and adioyned thereunto a very faire Church, dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to our B. Lady and S. Gregory. In the building of which Church,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:19779:66"/>whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome neighbours thereabout did leſſe fauour the enterprize, and did ſeeke to hinder the worke of God, they were take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of this world by his iuſt Iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And which is much to be admired, the holy Father, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he began to lay the foundations of that Church, did not know where to haue one penny of money towards the building therof, but truſted wholy to the liberall ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of God; and his hope was not in vaine, for there were ſo great and abundant Almes daily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon the worke, that the ſame was finished in a very goodly manner within two yeares; and in that ſpace, were giuen in Almes for that purpoſe aboue ſeauenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Crownes, beſides other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar great ſommes of money giuen by Princes and Senatours to the ſame end.</p>
               <p>This Houſe and Church being thus built and eſtablished, and the Order of Congregation of Oratory approued by the Pope S. Philip now
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:19779:67"/>bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to entertaine a number of very noble &amp; learned Diſciples, whom he inſtructed in all kind of vertue, &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplar diſcipline. And in the yeate 1587. he was declared Generall of the Order, in which dignity he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued vntill the yeare 1593. when he reſigned the ſame withall humility. As ſoone as he was made Generall, he wrote certaine Conſtitutions, which he preſcribed to be obſerued of all that should addict themſelues vnto his Order; but yet without bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any by vow, but voluntarily, as is yet obſerued therin.</p>
               <p>After this he grew to be ſickely, &amp; ſo continued for 2. or 3. yeares vntil his dying day; yet neuertheleſſe he left not off any worke of piety which he was accuſtomed to doe, as well in viſiting the ſicke, as otherwiſe; and in this time he wrought many miracles in the Citty, to the great aſtonishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and admiration of all Rome. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others, hearing that Pope Clement the VIII. in Eaſter Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:19779:67"/>was ſore troubled with the goute in his hand, he went vnto him to viſit him; and comming into his chamber, he began to imbrace the Pope according as his cuſtome was, through ancient familiarity. Hold, good Father, ſaid his Holines, and come no neerer me I pray you, for my hand is much pained. Feare no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſaid S. Philip; and there vpon taking him faſt by the ſore hand and kiſſing it, preſently the paine ceaſed, and was wholy driuen away. This happened in the yeare 1695.</p>
               <p>The ſame yeare, and a few dayes after, to wit in the month of Aprill, the holy Father fell very ſicke, and vpon the 12. day of May he was ſo ſurprized on the ſuddaine by a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vomiting of bloud, which then oppreſſed him, that it was greatly feared he would be ſuffocated; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was preſently annoyled by Ceſar Baronius, in the preſence of Frederike Borromeus the Cardinall, who at that time was come to viſit
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:19779:68"/>him. A litle after that he had receaued this Sacrament, he bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be better, opened his eyes, and his ſenſes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne againe. Then the Cardinall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him, if he would not receaue his Viaticum: wherto when he had yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the Cardinall in his owne perſon went to the Church, and fetched the ſame.</p>
               <p>As ſoone as Borromeus was entred into his Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber with the Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, the holy Father, all bedewed with teares, burſt forth in to theſe wordes: <hi>Behold my loue, Behold my loue: this is he wherin I delight, who only is deare to me. Giue him me Giue me my loue, and that preſently, that I may enioy him within me.</hi> And this he ſpake with ſuch vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of ſpirit, that he moued all the ſtanders by to teares. The ſame night he ſell againe into an agony with vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting of bloud, yet by the Phiſitians care he was preſerued from death. After a day or two, the Phiſitians co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming vnto him one morning ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what earely, he ſaid vnto them with
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:19779:68"/>a lowd voyce. Get you gone my Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, for I haue no more need of your helpe for the preſent. My ſoitting of bloud is now ſtayed and paine of my breſt is gone, &amp; I begin to get ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth a pace. The Phiſitia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s feeling his pulſe, found him to be in very good temper to their great amazement, and by and by he aroſe out of his bed, and began to follow his exerciſes as before, and ſo continued vntill the 25. of the ſame moneth, ſaying maſſe euery day with great alacrity of deuotion, ſo as he ſeemed to be now in very perfect health.</p>
               <p>Vpon the 25. day of May, which was that yeare the feaſt of <hi>Corpus Chriſti,</hi> which is in Rome kept moſt ſollemue of all the dayes in the yeare in ſaying of his Maſſe he ſeemed to pronounce the words in a new tune, as it were ſinging for ioy: after which he ſpent a great part of that day in hearing of Confeſſions, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating the people. In the afternone came to viſit him very many honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:19779:69"/>perſonages, amongſt whom were Cardinall Pamphilius, Auguſtinus Cuſanus Auditour of the Rota, and Spinellus Bencius Bishop of Politia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, whom he entertayned with a very merry countenance according to his fashion, although he knew the houre of his death drew very neere. Theſe forſaid Prelates that came to viſit him, would needs ſay the Office of the Breuiary with him, by which meanes they ſtayed there till it was farre in the eueninge. When ſupper time came, the holy Father eate very ſparingly, and was very well after ſupper: In ſo much as himſelfe then ſaid, that he had not bene better in health at any time for ten yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was at that preſent More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer he was ſo merry, and of ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant a countenance, that death was the leaſt thing thought on of all, but of himſelfe. After this he went to bed, and now deſiring to conceale his death no longer, though yet he ſpake obſcurely, he ſaid to thoſe that ſtood
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:19779:69"/>about him: <hi>Behold, we muſt all die.</hi> The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he asked what a clocke it was? And they anſwered that it was almoſt three; When two houres more shall be added, ſaid he, it wilbe fiue, &amp; after one more added to thoſe, it will be ſix. Then he ſaid, <hi>Goe yee all to bed in the name of God.</hi> And ſo they all departed. At ſix a clocke Antony Gallonius, the writer of this his life, that lay in a Chamber next vnto him, ſoddanly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waking, ſeemed to heare the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to walke vp and downe in his Chamber. Wherfore he aroſe ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ran vnto him; Where he found the holy man ſitting vpon his bed, &amp; his mouth full of bloud, which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to vomite in aboundance Heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon others were called, and many remedies applyed, but all in vaine. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a quarter of an houre after, the vomit ſtayed of it ſelfe, and he tooke breath, and ſpake very readily, ſo as all now thought the danger of death was paſt. By and by after, turning to his Diſciples (who by this time were
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:19779:70"/>come all into his chamber) he ſaid. <hi>Stay with me a while, for now I begin to ſtriue with death:</hi> Which words when he had ſpoken, he held his peace, and ſeemed to repoſe as if he had bene in prayer. Remayning in this ſort a good while. Caeſar Baronius read the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of the ſoule, all the reſt anſwering with watry eyes. When this was done, Baronius ſtood vp, and ſpeaking vnto him with a loud voyce, deſired that he would ſpeake vnto his Diſciples there preſent, and impart his benediction vnto them before he departed, The holy Father at theſe wordes opened his eyes, and lifting them vp towards heauen prayed a while, and after that, gaue them his bleſſing, and ſo without any ſigne of paine, or any griping, or gaſping, with a moſt ſweet and delectable countenance, he gaue vp his bleſſed ſoule to reſt, the 25. day of May, being the feaſt of <hi>Corpus Chriſti,</hi> in the yeare of our Lord 1595. about the ſixt houre within night, as himſelfe had fortold.</p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:19779:70"/>
               <p>As ſoone as he was dead, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared vnto many in the Citty, &amp; in particular to a very deuout religious virgin, cloathed with a very white &amp; pretious garment, ſaying thus vnto her. I am now as thou ſeeſt, called to the Crowne of my labours; haue thou a care, to follow the courſe of life thou haſt begun, and thou shalt enioy the ſame glory: and with this he vanished out of her ſight. The next morning his body was laid in the Church, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto all the Citty, great &amp; ſmall, rich and poore, made concourſe, and the Cardinalls and Princes of the Court did no leſſe, all reuerencing the body of the holy Father; and well was he that could come neere to kiſſe or touch the ſame. Others brought Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and flowers, and ſtrawed his body all ouer, but as faſt as they were laid vpon him, ſo faſt were they taken away, and gathered as pious ſpoiles, and applied to all ſorts of diſeaſes &amp; fores, wherby very many were cured.</p>
               <p>And whileſt he thus lay vpon the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:19779:71"/>Beere in the Church, one Auguſtinus Magiſtrius a Roman yong man, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a ſore in his necke, which had eaten two great holes, one to his mouth, and the other to his shoulder, and was pronunced incurable, came to the holy body, and after he had made his prayers, tooke the hand of S. Philip, and hauing kiſſed the ſame deuoutly, put it to his necke and tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the ſoare therwith, and was ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by preſently cured. As ſoone as he came home he tould a yong ſiſter of his, whoſe name was Margaret, who for ſix yeares had laboured of the ſame diſeaſe: preſently she haſted to the Church with her mother, and for that it was impoſſible for her, being but a girle to get vnto the body, for the preſſe of people, her mother tooke her vp in her armes &amp; carried her with maine ſtrength to the body, who taking the holy Fathers hand as her Brother had done, and touching her necke therwith, was alſo preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly healed. Herevpon the Father of the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:19779:71"/>yong man and maide, named Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, who was 60. yeares of age, and who had a running alſo in his eyes, which had continued aboue 2. mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths, ſo grieuous that he could not endure ſo much as the leaſt light of a candle, hearing of the cure of his two children, ran preſently to the holy body, and making his prayers, and doing as his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had done, he was alſo cured.</p>
               <p>Theſe miracles with many more being diuulged, there was ſuch run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for the ſpace of three dayes and neights vnto his body, that his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Congregation had great difficulty to bury him, which at laſt they found meanes to doe in a wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Coffin, in an humble graue at the foote of the High Altar. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Cardinall Pamphilius had vnderſtood thereof, he was much diſpleaſed therwith that a man ſo famous, and illuſtrious for miracles both aliue &amp; dead, should be laid in ſo humble a place; &amp; therfore dealt ſeriouſly with
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:19779:72"/>the Fathers of the ſame Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to remoue him: who conſulting the buſines with Cardinall Medices, he was taken vp, and put into a new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faire Coffin, which the ſaid Cardinall had cauſed to be made, and placed in a more decent place at one ſide of the High Altar, with an Arch made ouer the body; wherat miracles were wrought ſo frequently, that the walls about were preſently hung with vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Tables: and ſuch a moſt ſweet ſmell, as it were of Roſes and violets, was daily felt to proceed from his body, as was wonderfull.</p>
               <p>After ſome yeares that the holy Body had laine in this place, and ſo many miracles were daily wrought therat, a noble cittizen of Florence, who had obtained a Sonne by the prayers of S. Philip, cauſed a moſt ſumptuous and gorgeous chappell to be erected neere to the right ſide of the high altar, wherto his body was tranſlated, &amp; there remaineth to this day; and is reuerenced with great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:19779:72"/>of the whole Chriſtian world. He was canonized for a Saint the 12. day of March by Pope Gregory the fiftee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th in the yeares of our Lord 1622.</p>

For proofe of his zeale, charity, and liberality we may looke vpon the many Churches, Chappels,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:19779:75"/>Altars which he eyther builded or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, as alſo ſundry Colledges, and Seminaries which he erected for the education and inſtruction of youth, who should afterwards trauell in the vineyard of Ieſus Chriſt. In Milan he built a Colledge called the colledge of gentlemen, therin to inſtruct the young nobility in all vertue, learning, and diſcipline: and another for the cleargy of the Heluetians and Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers, where they are inſtructed in Philoſophy and Diuinity, to help the the conuerſion of their countries: which produceth ſuch exceeding fruit, that it may of right be called, the rampaire and defence of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Faith in the confines of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many. At Pauia he built another, called the colledge of Borromeus, which is without compariſon, the moſt goodly and moſt ſumptuous that is in all Europe, and endued the ſame with great reuenues. He foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a congregation of ſecular prieſt, called Oblats of S. Ambroſe. He
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:19779:76"/>built a Church neere our Ladies of Rauda, in his dioceſſe, in honor of the Queen of heauen: and another very ſumptuous in Milan called the Church of S. Fidelis, which hegaue to the fathers of the Society, for whom he alſo fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded the Colledge of Brera in Milan, where they read all ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, like vnto that which was erected in Rome by Pope Gregory the thirte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th. He likewiſe built a Colledge for the order of Theatins. Two other Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries he built in Milan, the one in the Church and houſe of Saint Iohn Baptiſt, capable of a hundred and fifty prieſts. The other, called Canonicall, wherin are reſident ſixty cleargy me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who ſtudy the holy Scripture, and caſes of Conſcience to become able to take vpon them the care of ſoules: two others alſo in the Dioceſſe of Celana. He erected two Conuents of the poore Clares with he babit of Capucineſſes, each containing fifty religious, who leade ſo holy and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtere a life, that all th Citty of Milan
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:19779:76"/>hold for aſſured, to be ſuccoured by their prayers in any neceſſity. He built alſo a houſe with prouiſion ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and temporall for poore mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, that were left fatherleſſe, that ſo their honeſty should be conſerued, and two for women which eyther were forſaken by their huſbands, or by ſome meanes had blemished their good name, or were any way in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſoule or body: and a Hoſpitall for thoſe that were infected with the plague.</p>
               <p>Finally, to omit many more of like ſorte for breuities ſake, he let paſſe no worke of charity towards poore and diſtreſſed perſons of either ſex, as well of body as of ſoule. For exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, at what time there was in Milan an infinit number of poore beggats ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together, who were ready to dye for hungar and thirſt (the plague being then in chiefeſt fury) he cauſed to be giuen vnto them, all the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that was in his houſe, and after commaunded all his ſiluer and golde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:19779:77"/>plate to be carried to the kings coy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and to be ſtamped into mony, and giuen vnto them. And moreouer he disfurnished his palace of all the tapiſtry, to the very carpets of his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, to cloth the poore againſt the rigor of the cold. Yea his charity ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded it ſelfe ſo far, as to lye himſelfe vpon the bordes, and cauſe his owne bed to be carried to the Hoſpitall. And further, he depriued himſelfe of the Dutchy of Auriana in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Naples, valued at ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Ducats yearly mony of Naples, giuing all that su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me vnto the poore, vnto Hoſpitals, and vnto other works of piety: ſo that one may iuſtly ſay, that S. Charles was much more affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted towards the poore, then he was towards his owne kinred. Amongſt ſixty or ſeauenty thouſand poore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſick of the plague, and of other diſeaſes, one was not to be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that wanted foode or rayment, ſo great was the care &amp; ſolicitude of S. Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, eſpecially to thoſe who were infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:19779:77"/>with the plague, to whome this pittifull Paſtour, did goe in perſon fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tent to te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to ſuccor &amp; viſit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they lay in the fields, which viſit he often continued till ſix or ſeauen houres within the night. And albeit he had in his traine a great number of prieſts, which he had ſent for out of Sauoy, to adminiſter vnto them the holy Sacraments, yet he himſelfe alſo vndertooke the ſame work ſo full of perill, as to viſit them, and to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the Sacraments vnto them with his owne hands, making no difficulty to ſtand by the beds ſide of thoſe that dyed, and to put them in mind of the mercy of God, and to giue them full pardon in the houre of death.</p>
               <p>Great likewiſe was the tempera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, abſtinence and auſterity of life of this holy Saint; who firſt accuſtomed to faſt once a weeke: then twice and afterwards foure tymes a weeke, and ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued vntill ſuch time, as quite for ſaking flesh, wine, and all other meates, he accuſtomed himſelfe to
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:19779:78"/>faſt euery day (except holy dayes) ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king only a meane refection in bread and water. He likewiſe got a cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, to eate and to ſtudy altogether ſo to gayne tyme: and many tymes he was found eating vpon his knees, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his reading of the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which he ſtill did read in that poſture of body, to declare the great reuerence that he bare therto. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes he remayned in the Church by occaſion of the forty houres prayer, all the tyme that they laſted: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in each houre preached to the people, the concourſe wherof was great both night and day. To theſe ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gors of faſtings, he added the chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cement of his body with whippes &amp; ſcourges, woare a shirt of haire, ſlept vpon a bed of ſtraw, or elſe vpon the bare bordes. He would not in the greateſt cold, come neere the fier, and alwaiſe had his handes bare, ſo that ſometimes the bloud iſſued from them.</p>
               <p>For an euident ſigne of the fancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this ſeruant of God and in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:19779:78"/>of his great zeale in defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the rightes &amp; priuiledges of the Church, and reforming of corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, crept in amongſt the religious and cleargy vnder his care, behold how the hand of Almighty God was very preſent, aſſiſting him, at ſuch tyme as a wicked Apoſtata attempted to ſlay him: the occaſion of which crime, was as followeth. This holy Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop endeauouring to reforme the order of the Religious called Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liats (of whome he was Protectour by order of the Apoſtolique Sea) and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to reſtraine their ſcandalous liberty, and to reduce them to the firſt obſeruation of their ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t rule; foure of them who ſtifly withſtood this reformation co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpired his death, not otherwiſe able to auoid reſtraint, by reaſon of the great zeale and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of their zealous paſtour and protectour. Wherupon one of them named Hierom Farina, for a ſumme of mony receiued, promiſed to be executioner of this murder. This fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:19779:79"/>therfore conducted by the diuell as a ſecond Iudas, in the yeare 1569. the 26. day of October, at one a clock in the night, finding S. Charles ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his cuſtome at prayer in his Bishops chappel, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the quier ſung theſe words of the ghoſpell; <hi>Let not your hart be troubled, nor feare you not.</hi> This wicked murderer, hauing got on ſecular apparell approaching neere vnto the Bishop, shot off a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoll, charged with a bullet, &amp; ſundry other murthring shot: the bullet wherof lighted full vpon his back, &amp; ſome of the other leſſer shot pierced his garments euen to his flesh, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers went thorough a table of an inch thick, and the reſidue did nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly batter the walls the were before him. Sodainly all the aſſiſtants roſe vp on their feete, and began to be ſore affrighted, he only who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the blow ſitting ſtill vpon his knees remained in peace not showing any ſigne of feare. But becauſe the blow had made him much to bowe
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:19779:79"/>downward, fearing they should thinke that he were ſlaine, holding his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des ſtill ioyned together, he at the laſt lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vp his head towards heauen, and hauing appeaſed thoſe that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, he ended the prayer he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, without ſo much as once more mouing his body. Afterwards reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring himſelfe to goe to reſt, he found that his Rochet was ſoyled with the bullet, and his other garments alſo, but were not pierced. Notwitha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, there appeared vpon his back a bu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch of a blewish coulor, like to dead flesh where the bullet had light, which fell at the feete of Saint Charles, as it were for reuerence, not drawing ſo much as a drop of bloud: which marke remayned vntill his death, for a memory of the fact. The Doctors of phiſick, and many others which had ſeene &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered the place that was shot, iudged that it was a cleere &amp; manifeſt miracle. In fine the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer was apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded with his foure companions, by the commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:19779:80"/>of the Duke Aſburquerco couernour of Mila<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by an edict which he publiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed the ſelfe ſame night, and shortly after were put to death for their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible fact.</p>
               <p>Hauing walked in the narrow way of this world, triumphed ouer vices, and adorned himſelfe with all the excellent vertues before rehearſed, the houre of his departure approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching neere, he firſt viſited the holy Sudary of our Sauiour Ieſus at Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rino, with a ſingular &amp; vnſpeakeable deuotion, and from thence went to the mount of Varalla neere vnto No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uara, where there is a deuout ſolitary place of Religious men, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher of our Sauiour is erected like vnto that in Hieruſalem with diuers other monuments of Chriſts paſſion, whervnto the holy man was ſpecially deuoted: where he abode the ſpace of fifteene dayes, exerciſing himſelfe in moſt auſtere workes of pennance, &amp; re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dring his ſoule capable of celeſtiall glory by a generall Confeſſion of all his life, with many ſighes and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:19779:80"/>of teares. But falling ſicke by his too much rigour, and feeling that his ſicknes increaſed, he returned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Milan, enflaming thoſe that went in his company in the loue of God by a burning charity wherwith he was wholy inflamed, and by his ſermons which he made of the glory of the bleſſed, which were ſo ful of fire, and ſo piercing, that the harts of thoſe that heard him were touched therwith in ſuch ſort that from their eyes diſtilled fountaines of teares.</p>
               <p>He arriued at Mila<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vpon the feaſt of All Soules towards euening and hauing paſſed the day following in holy diſcourſes, and receiued the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of the Church with ſingular deuotion and humility (holding his eyes fixed vpon a picture of the ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the dead) couered with a shirt of haire, and with ashes, like vnto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other S. Martin (whoſe vertues he had dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly imitated during his life) with great tranquility and quiet of body and mind, he rendred his ſoule
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:19779:81"/>vp to God, about three houres after ſunne ſetting, the laſt yeare of the Popedome of Gregory the 13. &amp; 47. yeare of his age. It is impoſſible to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what ſorrowe what lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tations and what ſighings, the vnexpected death of this moſt holy paſtor, cauſed both in poore and rich. The Church, deplored her vigilant Paſtour; the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunalls, their incorrupted iudge; the orphanes, their protectour and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender; and the needy, their moſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall benefactour. Finally, to ſatisfy the great deuotion of the people, which flowed thither on euery ſide, it was neceſſary to expoſe the body the ſpace of three dayes in the Church, to the view of euery one. The Bishops Pallace was filled with deepe ſighes, the ſtreetes with ſobbs, and the houſes with teares &amp; mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: ſo that there was not any in ſo great a multitude of people, which did not bewaile the loſſe of his good father (for hard it was to iudge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there were more people in the ſtreetes then vpon the topps of the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:19779:81"/>houſes) and who purſued not his moſt holy Paſtour with complaints and inconſolable ſorrow: in ſuch ſort, that all the people cryed out aloud, <hi>Mercy, mercy:</hi> euery one thinking himſelfe right happy, to touch with their beades or Roſary, his venerable hody.</p>
               <p>The miracles which Almighty God wrought by the interceſſion &amp; merits of S. Charles, were very many wherof theſe which follow were in part examined and approued for his canonization. He healed by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his holy prayer, Iohn Pietro Stopano, at this day Archbishop of Maccia in the valley of Telino, of a deadly diſeaſe, being forſaken of the phiſitians. By the ſigne of the croſſe, he preſerued the Abbot Bernardino Taruſi, and Ioſeph Cauallerio being drowned in the r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cino. By the force of his prayer, he ſaued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the perill of death, Iulio Homatto, who being on horſback, fell fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the top of a moſt high &amp; horrible precipice.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:19779:82"/>He draue away by the benediction of his hands, diuers diuells who had lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g tyme obſeſſed a young youth. With the ſame benediction he healed in an inſtant, one Margarete Vertua, who had a double tertian ague for the ſpace of eight mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ths, &amp; was brought vnto ſo low eſtate, that she could not (lying alwayes on her bed) moue ſo much as any one part of her body. In an inſtant, he likewiſe healed by his bleſſing, a noble woman, of a diſeaſe proceeding of witch-craft &amp; diuelish art.</p>
               <p>Theſe miracles with many others, were wrought by him during his life, but he wrought a great many more after his death: wherof for breuity ſake, I will recount only ſome, omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the circumſtances, which make the miracles the more famous, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare only the matter it ſelfe and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the things. Dame Paula Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtina Caſara, religious in the great monaſtery of Milan, hauing bene for the ſpace of eight yeares and a halfe paralitique, altogether dead on the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:19779:82"/>one ſide, infected with diuers other diſeaſes, and laſtly giuen ouer of the beſt Phiſitians of the Citty, finally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocated S. Charles Borromeus, and that with very great fruit: for as ſoone as she had made her prayer before the picture of S. Charles, by her ſted-faſt faith she was healed, the yeare 1601. vpon the feaſt of S. Ihon Baptiſt. And at the ſelfe ſame inſtant, fearing to be more ſlack in giuing tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes vnto the Saint, then he had beene to giue her health, she went forth of her cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, entred into the Church, and ſunge <hi>Te Deu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> together with the other religious who were all aſſembled to ſee this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle.</p>
               <p>Siſter Candida a religious woman of the conuent of Capucineſſes in Milan, hauing lyen three yeares ſick, and her diſeaſe being iudged incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the Doctors: hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the Sacraments ready to dye, aroſe vp whole and cheerfull from her bed, for that at the ſame inſtant, she had made a vow vnto S. Charles,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:19779:83"/>and had cauſed to be layd vpon her the gowne which he was wont to weare in his chamber: which she the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> went and carried with her owne ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds into the Church, to the great amaze went of the other religious. This ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened the yeare 1601. vpon the feaſt of S. Peter and S. Paul.</p>
               <p>In the month of October, the yeare 1604. Philip Naua of Mila<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, had a ſonne borne blind, his interior or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans being offended, that there ran downe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually a pricking humor, which had cauſed to grow without, two ſtrange clods or bunches of the bignes of halfe an egge, vnder the which the eyes were wholy hid and buried. This cauſed Lucina his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſeeing the defect to increaſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> day to day (the 25. day after his birth) to implore the aſſiſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of S. Charles, beſeeching him, that amongſt the many of his miracles, he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore her infant his eyes, and in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular for the loue of the name of Charles giuen vnto the infant at his
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:19779:83"/>Baptiſme. Inſtantly S. Charles ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in a viſible forme, and hauing giuen his benediction, reſtored to the child both ſight and perfect health of his deformity.</p>
               <p>The like hapned to one Martha Vighia of Milan, who hauing bene afflicted for fix whole yeares with the paine of her eyes, and after al ſorts of medicins, out of hope to recouer her ſight, S. Charles appeared vnto her in her ſleep, anno 1601. willing her to goe viſit his ſepulcher, &amp; ſo she should returne in perfect health: herevpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> she was led by the hand vnto the Church vpon a friday, where she made her prayers; &amp; as ſoone as she had kiſſed the ſtone of the ſepulcher of S. Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, her ſigth was entirely &amp; perfectly reſtored.</p>
               <p>Candida Franciſca, religious of S. Agnes in Milan, hauing kept her bed 22. monthes, was ſo greatly afflicted in al her body that the Doctors gaue her ouer as a dead woman: the 22. of Iune, anno 1601. holding in her ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:19779:84"/>the picture of Saint Charles, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoking him by moſt vrgent prayers preſently all her paines ceaſed and at the ſame inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, her right legge, which was a handfull shorter then the left, was reduced to the iuſt length and quantity of the other.</p>
               <p>Iohn Iacques Lomati, a gentleman of Milan, had his leggs ſo grieuouſly eaten and full of holes, that he could not ſtand vpon his feete, nor goe one ſtep without a ſtaffe: ſo that the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons of the Citty ſayd, that there was an end of Maſter Lomati. It chanced one day, that he was more ſorely torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted then ordinary; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon he went to the ſepulcher of S. Charles, and beſought his helpe. And to the end to obtaine the ſame ſo much the ſooner, he adiured this ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall cittizen ſaying: If thou be that Saint whom al the people doe ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, obtaine helpe of God formee. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly as he had made this prayer, &amp; that he had attentiuely heard the holy Maſſe, he fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d him ſelfe healed
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:19779:84"/>of all his euills, &amp; his ſoares co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerted into ſound and liuely flesh the 24. of September 1587.</p>
               <p>Ihon Baptiſta Tiron being a child of fiue yeares old, falling into the riuer of Ticinio, as ſoone as he had called to memory the name of S. Charles, before whoſe picture he was dayly wont to make his prayers (inſtructed herein by his father) this holy Prelat appeared preſently in viſible forme, who drew him forth of the flood, led him vpon the waues therof aboue a hundred cubits, &amp; brought him ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the banck, before the ſight of ſundry perſons, who deſpaired of the life of the child.</p>
               <p>Margaret, daughter of Angelo Monti of Milan, came out of her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wombe, with her two feet twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted together, ſo that the ſoles of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were turned backwards, &amp; the vpper part was vnder. She being ſix yeares old, and hauing ſtill this deformity, her mother called Militia Verga, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried her to the ſepulcher of S. Charles
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:19779:85"/>anno 1601. to craue helpe, offering a burning wax light vnto this friend of God for her daughter. The child lighted the wax, &amp; at the ſame inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, her right legge was ſet ſtreight and put in his place, and of iuſt length. By and by after she came againe, &amp; made and repeated her former prayer, and her left legge receiued the like cure: but yet a little marke ſtill remained of the precedent defect, in memory of the miracle.</p>
               <p>Ioane daughter of Ihon Baptiſta Maroni, cittizen of Milan, had from her birth her legges and her feete ſo exceeding crooked, that she could in no manner of ſort walke vpon them: and the ioynts of her knees being out of their place, she could make her legges turne this or that way, as she liſted, and eaſily could caſt them vpon her shoulders ſo that she trayled her ſelfe whither she would goe, vpon her ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des &amp; knees, with little creepers made of wood. The 4. yeare after her birth, her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <head>THE LIFE OF S. FRANCISCA of Rome gathered out of the writtings of her ghoſtly Father, and the Acts of her Canonization, by Iulius Vrſinus of the Society of Ieſus.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>AINT Franciſca was borne in Rome the yeare 1384. Her Fathers name was Paul de Buxis, and her mother Iaquelina de Rofredeſchi, both of a noble, and illuſtrious family, &amp; poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt with great riches. She was bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in the Church of Saint Agnes in Nauona. Her parents had a ſingular care to bring her vp in the feare, and loue of God: who made the ſame ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, euen in her infancy, what a one she should one day become. For not only did she reiect thoſe playes and toyes, with which children vſe to be pleaſed and delighted, but which is more admirable, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in her cradle she whould neuer permit ſo much as her
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:19779:87"/>parents, to touch, or handle her, vnles she were firſt clothed.</p>
               <p>Growing more in yeares, she fled from all the paſtimes of that age, and delighted only with ſolitude, by the benefit of which, she applied her ſelfe to prayer and deuotion, which together with her age ſo increaſed in her, that at eleaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yeares old, she diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered an earneſt deſire to retire her ſelfe from the world, and to ſerue God the reſt of her dayes in ſome Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery.</p>
               <p>One day she ſaw in ſpirit a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, graue, &amp; noble matrone, fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and neerely purſued, by many fearfull &amp; furious Gyants, wherwith she being moued to compaſſion, prayed for her deliuerance with ſuch feruour, that at laſt the matrone ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be wholy deliuered from the danger of her purſuers: which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trone she vnderſtood after to be the holy Church, &amp; the Giants that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued her, thoſe which at that time had diſturbed her peace by a dangerous
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:19779:87"/>Schiſme.</p>
               <p>In another viſion her glorious Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron Saint Paul the Apoſtle, together with the Holy Patriarch S. Benet, &amp; S. Mary Magdalen appeared to her, admonishing her to redouble her prayes and feruour, therby to appeaſe and auert the anger of God, and his plagues (which were already pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared) from falling on the Citty of Rome, to whom she obeyed, with ſuch feruour and earneſtnes, that she left not praying vntill she was giuen to vnderſtand, that the wrathe of God was withdrawne, and turned from Rome, and from the holy Church.</p>
               <p>She had likewiſe another Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation from S. Benet, that she was come into the world to helpe, to the ſaluation of ſoules, and that she was the particular guift of God to men in thoſe miſerable and wicked times, for the good of humane generation, and that therefore she was to apply her ſelfe wholy vnto their ayde.</p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:19779:88"/>
               <p>This child admirable in vertue and piety, hauing ſought &amp; deſired to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate her ſelfe wholy in ſome Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious monaſtery to God, at twelue yeares old, by the expreſſe, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of her parents, was conſtrayned to eſpouſe her ſelfe to Laurentius de Pontiano, a Roman Gentleman. After which mariage, she liuing in a Houſe of her huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, on the other ſide of Tyber made it knowne, by a great, and violent ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes that she there had, how gratefull that kind of life was vnto her. Being recouered from her ſicknes, she liued as much retired as she could, excuſing hir ſelfe from ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quets and feaſts both of parents and friends, and shunning all kind of ſports, wherwith others of her yeares and condition, vſed to be much recreated and delighted.</p>
               <p>All her delight was in prayer, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, and frequent viſitation of Churches, where she attended to the Diuine Office &amp; Sermons with great tendernes of deuotion. She exerciſed
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:19779:88"/>notwithſtandinge all thoſe vertues towards her huſband, which were moſt rare, or any way commendable in a wife: but aboue all, obedience, ioyned with ſuch a great reſpect and reuerence vnto him, that it is moſt certaine, that for the ſpace of 40. yeares that they liued together, the peace of ſacred mariage was neuer violated betweene them, by the leaſt vnkind word: for ſo perfectly and wholy had she ſubiected her will &amp; deſire vnto her huſband, that vpon what occaſion ſoeuer, she neuer ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to haue other will then what she ſaw to be his, If at any time she were called by her huſband, or by any other of the houſe, to put in order any houshold affaires, she would promptly leaue her prayers or any other kind of deuotion vnſinished, and goe to doe what she was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
               <p>It pleaſed our Lord one day by an eſpeciall miracle, to sheew how acceptable this her promptitude was
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:19779:89"/>vnto him: for in ſaying the Office of our B. Lady, she being called away foure times, and as ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being forced to leaue off in one, and the ſelfe ſame verſe, and at laſt returning, found that verſe written in godden letters, which was done by her good Angell, as S. Paul afterward in a viſion declared vnto her, by which it pleaſed our Lord to shew, in what manner we ought to prefer the obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce which we owe to our Superiours, before his owne ſeruice.</p>
               <p>The holy Sacrament of wedlocke, together with matrimoniall chaſtity, this holy woman conſerued in ſuch perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that euery one of her acts, was a ſeuerall teſtimony of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency, and purity: eſpecially by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall afflicting of her body, with wearing of haire cloth, diſciplines, &amp; ſuch like auſterities, it was eaſy to gather in what eſteeme she had all carnall concupiſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; delight. Her auſterities were ſo ſeuere, that her hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſband pittying her great and exceſſiue
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:19779:89"/>mortificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, accorded with her, for many yeares before his death, to paſſe the reſt of their liues in perfect conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency.</p>
               <p>The ſight of men not only was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing vnto her, but alſo afflicted her; but yet much more the ſight of vnchaſt and dishoneſt women, whom neuertheles (moued by an arde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity) she laboured earneſtly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert to God, and to retire from their lewd and naughty liues. One day paſſing towards the Iewes ſtreete, she ſaw diuers diuells dauncing in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine houſe, &amp; making great cheere, which moued her to enquire of the neighbours who they were that dwelt in that houſe; and hauing vnderſtood that there inhabited two famous Courteſans, who were much freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, she perſuaded their Landlord to put them out of his houſe, which was done, and the diuells abandoned their lodging.</p>
               <p>The foule Fienns for this cauſe, &amp; diuers others, were greatly enraged &amp;
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:19779:90"/>animated againſt this S. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſirous to reuenge themſelues, appeared vnto her, ſome times in the likenes of a man, ſometimes of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, euer in ſome or other laſciuious and dishoneſt manner: whome she made ſtill to depart confounded, and ashamed, through the inuocation of the holy name of Ieſus.</p>
               <p>But one day eſpecially the diuell being enraged againſt her, by reaſon of a notable conqueſt, that she had gotten ouer him, he brought into her chamber in the night, the body of a dead man, halfe putrified, caſting forth a moſt peſtilent and intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtinck, which he drew ouer all the parts of her naked bodie, ſo ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he left her all ouer infected with that moſt horrible ſtinke, but eſpecially there remayned a liuely, &amp; loathſome memory in her imagination, that for euer after, she neuer eate without vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting and loathing; and which is more, she conceyued therevpon ſuch an auerſion from all men, that
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:19779:90"/>whenſoeuer she came neere vnto any afterward she trembled with feare, and euen ſuppoſed then to feele the ſame moſt loathſome ſauour.</p>
               <p>She deſired of God to haue chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, not for earth, but for heauen, &amp; therfore when they were borne in bringing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp, she was more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to frame their minds then their bodies, and to teach them the art to die well, rather then any art wherby they might apply themſelues to line. She had one Sonne named Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt, who in his infancy was not only indued with more then mature wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but alſo with the guift of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy. This child playing one day with his Father, drew out a knife from the ſcabbard of his Fathers ſword, and putting the point thereof to the reynes of his ſaid Fathers back, told him, that in that very place he should shortly after receaue a da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, as it happened vnto him in the yeare 1406. in a ſedition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Romans, and the people
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:19779:91"/>of Ladiſlaus King of Naples. This Child likewiſe ſeeing another time a Frier paſſing along the way, told him that ere long he should change that habit for a more honorable, which prooued true, for the Frier was short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after created Bishop.</p>
               <p>The Citty of Rome being viſited with the plague, this little Saint fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling himſelfe ſtroken with the conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and knowing that he should shortly die, made great inſtance for Confeſſion; after which he told his mother, that S. Antony, and S. Onu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrius, to whome he was particularly deuoted, were come with a glorious company of Angells, to conduct him to heauen, and ſo this bleſſed child being only 9. yeares old, with an inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible ioy, paſſed from this fading life, vnto the ioyes of an euerlaſting bliſſe. At the inſtant of his departure, a little girle them lying ſick of the plaguein another houſe, &amp; hauing for a long time before bene ſpeachles, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly cryed out, that she ſaw Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:19779:91"/>de Pontiano, with great glory borne vp by Angells into heauen. S. Franciſca his Mother praying in her oratory about a yeare after, Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt appeared vnto her, of the ſame ſtature, and forme (only that he was aboue all expreſſion more faire and glorious) as he was when he died, hauing another Child with him of the ſame age, and no leſſe glorious, who declared vnto his mother, that he was placed in heauen among the ſecond quire of Angells, and that the principall cauſe of his coming was to lead along with him to heauen, his ſiſter Agnes, she being only 5. yeares old, whoſe place was prepared in heauen equall to his. Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes therfore shortly after falling ſick, her mother ſaw a faire white doue flying vp &amp; downe ouer her bed, not departing, till this child had rendred her innocent ſoule, into the hands of Angells.</p>
               <p>God had giuen to S. Franciſca an Angell, not only to defend and guard
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:19779:92"/>her from euill ſpirits, but alſo to rule, and direct her in all her actions: he neuer left her one moment, and by eſpeciall priuildge she inioyed the ſight of him continually. He was of an incredible beauty, a countenance wondrous gratious, more white then ſnow, more ruddy then the roſe, his eyes euer looking vp towards heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, his armes croſſed on his breaſt, his haire long and curled, more cleere &amp; shining, then the polisht gold, his robe extended long vnto the ground, and was for the moſt part of a pure white colour, other times skyblew, ſometimes alſo red. Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his face pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ſo great a light &amp; brightnes, that it often dazeled her eyes to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it, and ſometimes there procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſuch beames, that only by their brightnes, she ſaw to read her Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins at midnight. Her Ghoſtly Father co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded her once to diſcloſe vnto him, the forme, and shape of her good Angell, which she did (holding her Angell by the little ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, &amp; the whilſt
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:19779:92"/>looking friendly vpon him) ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, and ſo particularly, that therby her Confeſſor eaſily perceaued his proportion, not to exceed a child of 5. or 6. yeares old.</p>
               <p>If at any time the diuell moleſted her, either with horrible apparitions to afright her, or by transforming himſelfe into ſome holy shape to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude her, her faithfull Guardia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Angell at the ſame inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by the shaking and mouing of his golden locks, would caſt forth ſuch comfortable beames, as would make her ſoule at once both feareles and ſecure.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, if in company of her parents or friends, there eſcaped from her either any inconſiderate thought, word, or deed, or if she were to ſollicitous of her domeſticall affai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, preſently she might behould this bleſſed ſpirit turne away his eyes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her, wherby she became to reflect on herſelfe, and carefull to examine her co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; ſo by knowledge of thoſe ſmall faults that had cauſed his auer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:19779:93"/>by this meanes she became daily more wary and vigilant ouer herſelfe, euer renewing her purpoſes to ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, wherby she recouered the ſweet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of her Angell. If any one in the company of this Saint forgot them ſelues in doing any thing that was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent, she preſently perceaued her Angell, as it were, in horrour of their ſinnes and imperfections, to cloſe his eyes with his hands.</p>
               <p>A Gentlewoman, a deere friend and kinſwoman of hers, called Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſia, being in a deſperate ſickneſſe, had a great deſire to eate of a Crab fish, after which Francis carefully ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and finding that in that ſeaſon of the yeare they were impoſſible to be had, she put herſelfe, in prayer, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring one from God, when behold in the ſight of all the houshould, there fell one from the ſeeling of the Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber fresh and aliue, as if newly taken our of the ſea, which she preſently prepared for Vannoſia, who eating thereof was not only ſatisfied of her deſire, but alſo perfectly recouered of
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:19779:93"/>her ſicknes.</p>
               <p>She neuer diſmiſſed any poore fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her gate without almes, and once in a great famine at Rome, Andreas her Father-in-law hauing made his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of an excellent tunne of wine, she being importuned by the poore, &amp; not hauing wherwithall to ſatisfy them, gaue to all that came of the ſaid wine as long as it laſted. Which when her Father-in-law vnderſtood, he was much offended with her therefore, of which she hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bly excuſed herſelfe, aſſuring him that his wine was not ſpent, but euen as he left it, which to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme she we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with him downe into the Cellar, where drawing of the ſame tunne, they found it full of moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent wine. Whervpon Andreas being not ignorant of her beſtowing it, was confirmed of the miracle, and she acknowledginge Gods bounty, remayned therafter more animated to doe the workes of charity.</p>
               <p>Another time hauing giuen to the poore a little qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tity of corne which
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:19779:94"/>she had ſwept from the beames and rafters of her huſbands granary, by chance returning thither not long after, she found there fourty meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of fine wheat, neither she nor any other, knowing how it came thither. She vſed to reſerue for herſelfe thoſe hard and mouldy cruſts &amp; chippings of bread, which were appointed for the poore, and in the place therof, would ſecretly giue vnto them the beſt and pureſt bread, that was in the houſe.</p>
               <p>Although all the actions of this Saints life, were full of rare examples of Humility, notwithſtanding it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in nothing more, then in her art and holy ſubtility to conceale the frequent miracles that she wrought: for wheras she healed all ſorts of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes by her only touch, yet she would withall apply a certaine oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the diſeaſed, which she had made of Mariolane, or Rew, therby to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceale the miracle, although this ointment for ſome diſeaſes was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vnprofitable, and for many
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:19779:94"/>abſolutely hurtefull. She neuer went veſted but in courſe cloth, although her condition was no leſſe then No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. She had a vineyard out of Rome, without S. Paules gate, from whence she vſed ordinarily to bring fagots made of vine branches (or of other wood which the place afforded) vnto Rome on her head, and there to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute it amongſt the poore, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes she hath bene ſeene toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with her Companion Vannoſia, begging in the Citty from doore to doore, during a great famine, for the reliefe of poore people.</p>
               <p>Her patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is incredible, in bearing as well the aduerſities of the body as of the mind, for when her huſband (for being engaged in the ciuill broy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of the Citty) was banisht, and his goods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fiſcated, and her brother-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law Paulinus ſent likewiſe into a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable exile, and her ſonne I hon Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta, taken forcibly away from her for hoſtage, the ſpirit of this S. remained victorious and vndaunted, as well in
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:19779:95"/>the loſſe of her childrne as of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band &amp; friends. She prayſed God, in the ruine of ſo rich &amp; honorable a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily ſo neerly concerning her as that of her huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds did: in briefe, in all the aſſaults and afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s with which the diuell aſſayled her patience, she got the victory, put him to shame &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and euer prayſed God.</p>
               <p>She did eate ordinarily but once a day, and then very ſparingly, and for the moſt part fed vpon hearbes or rootes, which she did eate only with ſalt. She abſtayned both from wine &amp; fish, and neuer did eate flesh but in great neceſſity, and then in very little quantity. She alwayes eate without appetite, for she had ſo loſt and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified her taſt by her co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall faſting and abſtine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that the moſt ſweeteſt things ſeemed to her bitter and vnſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uory. When she was not with her hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſband, she vſed to repoſe her body vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a bed ſo ſtraite, as she mightmore properly be ſaid to ſit and leane, then lye or reſt thereon. She vſed to ſleepe
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:19779:95"/>in her clothes, and that only but two houres in the night, and yet (contrary to the generall cuſtome of Italy) she neuer ſlept in the day. She girded a sharpe hairecloth vnto her naked body, with a great girdle made of horſe haire, that it might the more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict her: she diſciplined herſelfe ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily with a diſcipline of ſix cordes, ech corde hauing a rowell at the end. She vſed alſo a hoope of iron, which she faſtned ſo ſtraitly vnto her skin, that it became almoſt buried in the flesh: which hoope &amp; the diſcipline, her Ghoſtly Father commaunded to vſe nomore, and which, together with her hairecloth, are to be ſeene at this day in her Monaſtery.</p>
               <p>She made her a cup of a dead ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s Scull, for to drinke that little water in, which she vſed for the ſuſtenance of nature, both to diminish the little pleaſure she might haue in drinking, by the hortor of that ſpectacle, as alſo to haue euer before her eyes, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory and image of death. She had
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:19779:96"/>accuſtomed ſo often, and ſo violently to beate her breſt, that it became hardned like brawne: &amp; if it hapned, that she offended neuer ſo little, by any one part of her body, vpon the ſame part would she preſently and pittifully reuenge her ſelfe. And if her tongue had offended, she would byte it till the bloud followed, and ſo in like manner on any other part or ſenſe.</p>
               <p>This Saint went cuſtomarily to confeſſion euery Wedenſday, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday, and to Communion at the leaſt once a weeke, she viſited often the Churches of S. Peter in the Vati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, S.

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:19779:96"/>was deceaued of her expectation, but not by his impoſture: for preſently she feeling the want of thoſe inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour comforts of her ſoule, which she vſed to receaue by the preſence of her ſpouſe, knew he was abſent, whereof (with a great and ſenſible feeling of the loſſe) she complained to Father <hi>Antony de Monte Sabellio,</hi> at that time her Ghoſtly Father, who thereupon examined the Prieſt, and he confeſſed the crime, and humbly begged pardon, and ſecrecie of the offence.</p>
               <p>This Saint being one day retired with her Holy Companion Vanno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, to a hidden Oratory which she had made in her garden, vnder the shadow of an Arbor, being then the moneth of Aprill, it pleaſed God to shew them both how gratfull their retireme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as alſo their commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication together (which was about the withdrawing themſelues wholy from the world) was vnto him, by his great bounty, in cauſing that from
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:19779:97"/>the Arbor there dropped downe at their feete ripe peares both faire and excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, although both out of ſeaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; not the naturall fruite of that tree; which they hauing taſted, &amp; finding wonderfull pleaſant and delectable, bare the reſt vnto their huſbands, therby to ſtirre vp in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion and confidence in God.</p>
               <p>After the death of her huſband, she retired her ſelfe into a Monaſtery, which she had ſo long and earneſtly deſired, wherin she attained to a moſt high degree of perfection, &amp; became a moſt perfect patterne of all ſanctity of life &amp; holines: In ſo much, that after a while she was choſen Gouerneſſe of the whole houſe, &amp; had many wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy diſciples and Virgins vnder her, whome she inſtructed with ſuch ſweetnes, &amp; feruour of ſpirit, hauing receaued a wonderfull new light, &amp; learning from heauen, that she was a mirrour to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all. She was very often rapt in extaſie, and had therin ſuch ſweet and ſenſible communication
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:19779:97"/>with her Lord and ſpouſe Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, as was wonderfull; of whome she learned infinite myſteries, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came indued with ſo diuine and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall a ſpirit, that God gaue vnto her the priuiledge of kowing the ſtate of all ſuch perſons ſoules, as came in her preſence.</p>
               <p>And thus this Bleſſed S. heaping vp daily more and more merit, by her great Sanctity of life, she fell into her laſt ſicknes the yeare of our Lord 1440. who by diuine reuelation was admonished of the day and houre of her death. Wherfore she making co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall preparation therto, without any great ſicknes of body, when the day came, she heard maſſe, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, and ſpent all the reſt of the ſame day in ſpirituall communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with her ſiſters and diſciples, ſaying the houres of the Breuiary, Euenſong, and Compline with them: and when the night grew on, she ſeemed to take her laſt leaue of them all, and ſetting her ſelfe as it were in
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:19779:98"/>prayer, being rapt into an extaſy, and talking with her ſpouſe, she pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rendred her holy ſoule into the hands of her Creatour.</p>
               <p>Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was knowne she was dead, there was ſuch a wonderfull co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>courſe of people to doe honour to her holy body, as was ſtrange: and the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles that were wrought therat, are ſufficient to make a good volume by themſelues. Her body was carried to our bleſſed Ladies new Church, neere vnto Campo Vaccino, commonly called S. <hi>Maria Nuoua,</hi> and there with great ſolemnity and veneration inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, wherat miracles haue bene daily euer ſince wrought, and the ſame is greatly honoured and reuerenced, by all the people of Rome euen vntill this day. She was Canonized for a S. by Pope Paul the fifth, the 29. day of May, in the yeare of our Lord 1606. Her feaſt is vſually celebrated vpon the ninth day of March.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the famous Citty of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uila, in the Kingdome of Caſtile in Spaine, was borne the holy and glorious Saint Tereſa, vpon the 28. of March, in the yeare of our Lord 1515. Her Father was called Alfonſo Cepeda, and her mother Batrixe Ahumada. Both were noble, and excelled in all kind of piety and vertue; wherein with great care, they brought vp their children: &amp; in particular this their yong and tender daughter.</p>
               <p>She being about the age of ſeauen yeares, &amp; contemplating of the ioyes, and glory of heauen, would ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce to her ſelfe theſe words, and ſay: O Eternity, Eternity, Eternity! v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:19779:99"/>alſo daily many prayers, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Roſary, &amp; (by her mothers inſtruction) made very deuout to our Bleſſed Lady.</p>
               <p>In theſe her yong yeares, reading in the liues of Saints, the torments, &amp; deaths of the Bleſſed martyrs, and the glory they had obtayned therby, she iudged that they had gotten heauen at an eaſy rate; wishing, that she might ſuffer the like paines, to attaine the like glory. And being inflamed thus with the loue of heauen, and of death for Chriſt his ſake, she inſtilled the like deſire into her yong brother, in ſuch ſort, that they determined ioint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to goe together amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the Moores, that at their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds they might receaue the crowne of martyrdome. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning their iourney; they met with their vncle, who (by intercepting) hindred them, and brought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> back to their parents.</p>
               <p>Their intention thus croſſed, as they remained in their Fathers houſe, they paſſed their time often in the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:19779:99"/>Garden, and Orchard, where they would build little houſes, like Celles, and Hermitages, and though after the manner of childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet it fore shewed what she should afterward acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plish, as inded she did.</p>
               <p>At the age of 12. yeares her mother died, whereat being much afflicted, she prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted herſelfe before an image of our B. Lady, deſiring her to be her mother, whome she euer after found ready with her protection, helpe, and aſſiſtance in all her neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>Now our Lord began to enkindle in this his ſeruant, the ſpirit of prayer and inward deuotion, in ſo much, that at the age of 20. yeares, she fully deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed the world, and deſired earneſtly a Religious courſe of life; though her Father out of his extraordinary loue to her, would not conſent therto. Yet she remembring the counſell of S. Hierome, brake violently from all, and entred into the Monaſtery of the Order of the Incarnation in Auila,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:19779:100"/>where she paſſed her Nouiceship, with great alacrity and comfort.</p>
               <p>Shortly after, she falling into an extreme ſicknes, her Father was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to couey her into the country, to the houſe of a phiſitian for helpe. But it auayled not, for her infirmity did daily, and diuerſly increaſe, and in ſuch ſort, that all being out of hope of her life, the laſt Sacraments were miniſtred vnto her, &amp; she lay a dying. At which time she was in a traunce for foure dayes, and comming to her ſelfe againe, she complained of thoſe, that had called her back from heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, where she ſaid, she had ſeene many myſteries, as alſo the ſaluation of her Father, &amp; diuers other friendes which should be ſaued by her meanes, and many Monaſteries which she was to erect, and her owne happy death: all which proued afterward true.</p>
               <p>After her recouery, by her prayers, she obtayned health for a Religious perſon of their Monaſtery, and new amendment of life for a Prieſt, who
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:19779:100"/>was beſotted with the dishoneſt loue of a woman, who had bewitched him with her diuellish inchantments, by a Copper Idoll which she had giuen him to weare, which this holy woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> obtayning of him, caſt into a riuer, whereby he was freed, and lead after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a vertuous life, and died bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly. And for diuers others she ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained health, and many she reduced to vertuous life, by her example and prayers, and by the interceſſion of S. Ioſeph, to whom she was very affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate, and deuout.</p>
               <p>Being on a time at her prayers, she caſt her ſelfe proſtrate before a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Picture of our B. Sauiour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching his grace, and aſſiſtance, to protect her, from offending him any more: from which time euer after, she found continuall increaſe of ſpirituall comforts, and alſo amendement of her former life. For after this time, our Lord did communicate himſelfe vnto her in diuers manners, aſwell in inward and ſpirituall comforts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſing
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:19779:101"/>&amp; ſpeaking to her ſoule, as alſo by outward and plaine apparitions; guiding, and directinge her with his counſell in all her affaires of difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſpeaking to her in his owne voice.</p>
               <p>She being once ſurpriſed with an extaſy, our Lord ſaid to her; <hi>My will is that hereafter thou be not conuerſant with men, but with Angells:</hi> which wordes made ſuch impreſſion in her, as from that time, she wholly abandoned the world, and all humane things, &amp; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered only to God. Our Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this time teaching and adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her (her ſanctity being ſuſpected by others) what she should ſay, &amp; anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were, to ſtop their mouths, as she euer did. And our Lord ſaid alſo to her: <hi>Feare not daughter, for I will not leaue thee.</hi> Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which time forward, she ſeemed wholly vnited to God.</p>
               <p>Being once in her deuotions, our B. Sauiour appeared to her againe, hauing with him S. Peter, &amp; S. Paul and shewed to her firſt his hands shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:19779:101"/>beautifully, and after that his face: and thus continued with her the ſpace of three daies.</p>
               <p>Alſo hearing Maſſe vpon S. Pauls day, our Bleſſed Sauiour appeared to her in his humanity very glorious. And theſe apparitions of our Sauiour at Maſſe time in diuers formes, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to her, more then three yeares. Theſe viſions being very frequent &amp; increaſing, her Confeſſor, and diuers others grew ſuſpitious, that they might be illuſions of the deuill, and she be deceiued: but our Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe did with his preſence and ſpeach to her, both ſatisfy, and inſtruct her, how she should ſtop the ſlaunderous mouths of all. After this a Seraphim appeared to her with a flaming dart in his hand, wherwith he ſeemed to pierce her hart ſo, as from that time forward she remained wholy infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with the loue of God, and of which wound she felt at diuers times very ſenſible paine.</p>
               <p>Once in a viſion she was taken vp
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:19779:102"/>to heauen, where she ſaw ſuch miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and fulnes of glory and ioyes, as cannot be expreſſed: Our Lord ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her: <hi>Conſider daughter, how great ioyes worldlings depriue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues of.</hi> Theſe viſions came to her very often, and in diuers kindes: As of the bleſſed Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of our bleſſed Sauiour, of our B. Lady, of S. Peter and S. Paul, &amp; of the Angels: yea, and theſe were not only in ſpirit, but her body alſo hath bene ſeene many times eleuated from the ground, vntill through her humility she deſired of our Lord the ceſſation of that miraculous fauour, which he graunted her.</p>
               <p>This holy Saint was fearfull her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, leaſt it might be a deceit of the deuill, and therfore was content to be narrowly ſifted, and examined with all diligence, not only in her Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, but alſo in her life, particuler actions, and proceedings, which were ſearched, by very many Fathers of the Society of Ieſus, and almoſt by fourty other principall, and the moſt
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:19779:102"/>famous learned men in Spaine, and other Countries, all graue, and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend, and the beſt ſpirituall Maiſters then liuing: who all allowed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued her life, &amp; her proceedings for good and vertuous, free from il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion, or deceit.</p>
               <p>After this, the holy Saint beginning to build a Monaſtery, our B. Lady &amp; S. Ioſeph appeared to her, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to protect, and aſſiſt her, which did encourage her ſo much, as though she found many difficulties, yet she brought at laſt to good effect and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished the ſame. Adding to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer rules, ſome others concerning Mentall Prayer, and Meditation, all which were approued by the Popes Holines. And at the end, our Bleſſed Sauiour appeared to her, and ſet a crowne vpon her head, as a reward of her former trauailes.</p>
               <p>She founded diuers other Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries after this to the number of ſeauenteene well knowne, as in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina del Campo, in Duruell, in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laga,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:19779:103"/>in Valladolid, in Toledo, in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrana, in Salamanca, in Alua de Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, in Segouia, in Beas, in Seuill, in Carauaque, in Xare, in Palencia, in Sorie, in Granada, in Burgos. Beſides theſe, she founded diuers others, as namely, fifteene for the diſcalced Brothers, all well knowne in Spaine.</p>
               <p>In all theſe her Monaſteries she cauſed a reformation, with addition of many good, and ſpirituall conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, all approoued by her Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, and confirmed by the Pope. And during her life time (with her infatigable labour, and continuall trauell from one to another) she go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned them all, in moſt exact obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance of their rules, and exe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plar life; to the great edification of all, &amp; ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of many in the way of more vertuous life.</p>
               <p>She wrote foure bookes, One, <hi>of her owne life,</hi> by commaund of her Ghoſtly Father, one, <hi>of the way of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> one, <hi>Of the Foundation of her Monaſteries.</hi>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:19779:103"/>And afterward three other bookes, contayning relations of her life, and of deuout prayers. All which ſaid bookes, being approoued both by the Inquiſition, and the graue, &amp; lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Father aforeſaid, her Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſours, with diuers others, and being ſound and Catholike Doctrine, and full of diuine learning and wholeſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, were thought good to be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated into diuers languages, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers reading her holy life, &amp; follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſells, might profit therby, and increaſe in vertue, to the ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their ſoules, as very many haue done, by her meanes, as was before shewed vnto her in a viſion.</p>
               <p>The vertues of this Saint, were very many and manifeſt, and great ſtore of examples there be therof in euery kind, though for breuity ſake, I will but touch, and only name a few of them. Firſt she was ſo carefull in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruance of the Commandements of Almighty God, as her Confeſſour thought, she neuer committed any
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:19779:104"/>mortall ſinne. Her obedience was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary to all her Superiours, and Prelats, in all things, both humane, &amp; diuine. The guift of Chaſtity, giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her by our Bleſſed Sauiour, was ſuch, as she was ſurnamed by her Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors: <hi>The treaſure of Virginity.</hi> And the purity of her mind appeared well, by thevncorruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of her body after her death, and by the modeſt obſeruances she appointed for her Nunnes, as the couering of their faces with a veile, their ſtrict in cloſure, their ſilence, and other the like.</p>
               <p>She had a great loue to pouerty, praiſing it, and commending it to her Nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes, &amp; that not only in their holy eſtate, in hauing their meanes without certainty of maintenance, and their houſe without rent, but alſo in their habit, which she choſe to be very meane. Yet principally she commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and preferred inward pouerty of ſpirit, wherin she was a rare, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplar patterne to all.</p>
               <p>In taming of her flesh, she was very
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:19779:104"/>rigorous, and auſtere, for beſides her ſpare diet, she vſed sharpe diſciplines, ſometimes with cordes, with keyes, with Iron chaines, wearing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a hairecloth next her skin, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayninge her Order to be one of the ſtricteſt in the Church of God. And if any meate was made ſomething more dainty by the fire, as either ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, or baked, she would refuſe it, ſaying: <hi>Meate is to nourrish our bodies, not to delight the taſte.</hi> Her ſleepe was ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome aboue three houres in a night, all the reſt she ſpent in prayer.</p>
               <p>In humility she excelled, giuing many worthy teſtimonies thereof, in diuers places both at Rome and abroad, ſeruing all the reſt of the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters (by her good will) in the loweſt, ad baſeſt Offices in the houſe. Her courage was great, as appeared by her continuall trauells, and troubles, in erecting Monaſteries, which yet at laſt she alwayes brought to good effect: Beſides the often apparition: of deuills, which she feared not, but
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:19779:105"/>euer chaſed a way from her, euen as flies.</p>
               <p>Such was her admirable patience in all croſſes, and afflictions, as she tooke great ioy, &amp; comfort in ſuffring them, hauing an ardent deſire to die for Chriſt his ſake, and hauing theſe wordes often in her mouth: <hi>O Lord graunt me either to die, or at leaſt to ſuffer for thy ſake.</hi> In her body, she ſuffered long and grieuous ſickneſſes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, beſides her continuall tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, and toyle. In her reputation &amp; honour she ſuffered great detriment, and no leſſe inward ſpirituall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bats and deſolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in her ſoule. To ſpeake of the wonderfull Prudence of this holy Saint, in gouerning of her many Monaſteries, of her ſimplicity, &amp; ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere vertue in religion, and aboue all, her extraordinary deuotion to the Bleſſed Sacrament of the Altar, and her other vertues, wherein she did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, and was ſo exemplar, it would truly fill whole volumes.</p>
               <p>The ſame may be ſaid of her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:19779:105"/>contemplation, of her eminent Faith, of her Hope, of her enflamed Loue to God: of her Charity to wards her neighbour, of her forcible, &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſiue vertue of ſpeach, her grace of interpretation of Scriptures, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy, and in diſcerning of ſpirits. And for all theſe her vertues, ſeruice, and loue vnto our Lord, it may well cauſe admiration in vs to conſider his reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procall loue, and his continuall, high and diuine fauours donevnto her: His often conſolations to her ſoule, and inward ſpirituall apparitions, as alſo corporally and frequently in diuers formes and manners, inſtructing, and directing her from time to time, how she should proceed, in all her affaires of importance, beſt to his liking and ſeruice: As alſo dictating to her with his owne voice, the very words she should ſpeake, to ſatisfy doubts, and anſwere all obiections.</p>
               <p>She had an extraordinary guift in healing of the ſick of all infirmities by her prayers, and working other mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:19779:106"/>ſo vſually, &amp; as I may ſay fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly, as it ſeemed our Lord neuer denied her any thing that she reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted of him. The aged, &amp; weake body of this holy woman, almoſt ſpent and worne out with continuall trauell fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one Monaſtery to another, being now at Burgos, and foreſeing her end approaching (which she had prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied 8. yeares before) haſtened to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Auila, where she was borne, deſiring to end her daies therein her firſt owne Houſe. But repoſing (as she trauelled) at the houſe of the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſſe of Alua, she was enforced there to make ſtay, partly by her importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as alſo by reaſon of a feuer she had which continued with her, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed ſo inceſſantly, that at the end of three dayes, hauing receaued all the rites of the Holy Catholike Church, recommended her ſelfe to God, with many deuout prayers, and giuen many holeſome precepts and admonitions to thoſe that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to their great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, &amp; edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:19779:106"/>with a ioyfull, and peaceable ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity of mind, she ſweetly yeelded vp her ſoule to her beloued ſpouſe &amp; Sauiour, vpon the 4. day of October, being the feaſt of S. Francis, in the 68. yeare of her age, &amp; 47. of her being religious.</p>
               <p>It pleaſed our Lord to shew the holines of this Saint by ſome ſignes at her death, &amp; by many miracles after. For at the inſtant of her death, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Religious woman, ſaw two ſtarres to deſcend vpon her Cell. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſiſter ſaw a bright ſtarre shin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ouer her Monaſtery, &amp; another ſtarre at the window of the chamber where she died. A Religious man in Valladolid ſaw (at the inſtant of her death) the heauens open, and a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious way prepared, wherby a ſoule aſcended. The prioreſſe of Segouia, ſmelt in her Cell a moſt ſweet odour at the inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of her death, with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary light. Another Prioreſſe in Paris ſaw our Sauiour aſcend to heauen with great glory, &amp; many An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:19779:107"/>with him. Another ſiſter ſaw a white doue to aſcend fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her mouth. All her Conuent at the inſtant ſaw a great light, and felt a very ſweet ſmell, fillinge the houſe: as alſo from her habit, and all things that she had touched.</p>
               <p>The body of this holy Saint lying faire, fresh, and liuely, as though she had bene yet liuing, a certaine Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> came, and touched with her handes his head, and eyes, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently recouered of two infirmities which he had in thoſe parts. Another Religious woman kiſſing her ſeete, recouered her ſmelling which she had loſt. And that night after her death, she appeared to diuers Religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>After that her body had bene by many and with great deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> viſited, she was with great ſollemnity, &amp; due reuerence enterred. Her habit, and all things that she vſed, be kept ſtill in Alua, with great reuerence for holy Reliques, and many miracles haue
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:19779:107"/>bene wrought by them.</p>
               <p>This holy Saint appeared to diuers after her death: and firſt, to one Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Antonetta, in Granada, she wing her the glory that she was in, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging her in her vertuous courſe of life. Alſo to a Religious woman in Auila, she appeared in great glory. She appeared alſo in Segouia (with a ſweet odour) in the mideſt of the Quier, with a rich crowne on her head. And to the Earle of Oſorne, to the Bishop, and diuers others there.</p>
               <p>The miracles after her death were many. As the miraculous incorruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of her body. The pleaſant odour, and ſweetnes therof, filling the place where it was kept, as alſo of her ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, cloathes, and all things she had touched. By which (being religiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kept) many of ſundry infirmities were healed. Alſo there was a pretious oyle, or liquor, that diſtilled conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually from her body, and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euery ſmall part therof, though ſeparated a ſunder, whereby many miracles were
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:19779:108"/>done, as appeareth by one of her ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds that was carried by the Prouinciall of her Order to Liſbone, and by one of her fingers at Malaga. Alſo a linne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cloth died with her bloud, continued pure, and fresh, wherby many mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles were done, in diuers places, and in diuers manners.</p>
               <p>Don Aluarez de mendoza Bishop of Alua, hauing in his life time built a faire chappell, with a Tombe therin for himſelfe, an (by a fore-contract with the Prouinciall of her Order) another by it for this holy Saint, and hearing now of her death and buriall, made ſuite iointly with the people of the towne to the Prouinciall for her body, which not being obtayned, she was tranſlated to Auila in the moneth of Noue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber 1585. with great ſollem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and ioy. But the Duke of Alua, and Ferdinand of Toledo Prior of S. Ihons, made ſuit to Pope Sixtus V. for her returne to Alua where she died, which he graunted, and ſo with greater ioy, and applauſe she was
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:19779:108"/>brought back to Alua the 23. of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt 1586. where she remayneth, and God by meanes of this his ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t doth worke many miracles, euen to this preſent: as is daily ſeene by thoſe that be deuout vnto her, and frequent her ſepulcher; the which hath bene adorned &amp; enriched with many great guiftes, and pretious Iewells, of many of the greateſt Princes, and Religious Bishops, and Perſons of Spaine, and Chriſtendome. And after all due di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and examinations of her life, and miracles made, as in ſuch caſes appertayneth, she was Canonized for a Saint by Pope Gregory the XV. vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the 12. of March 1622. But her feaſt is celebrated vpon the 4. day of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
               <p>To rehearſe the manifold exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples in euery of her ſeuerall vertues, the frequent apparitions of our Bleſſed Sauiour, and other Saints, her viſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, raptes, and miracles, accordinge to the truth thereof, and her deſert, I should neuer be able to ſay inough,

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>LESSED Lewis Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaga was borne in that part of France which lyeth beyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the Alpes, at the Chaſtle of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilion in the Dioceſe of Brixia, in the yeare of our Lord 1568. of Ferdinand Prince of the Empire, and Marques of the aboue named Caſtilion, and of Martha Tana-Sanrenia no leſſe No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as the Inhabita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts about the Alpes can teſtify, and vertuous, as appeareth in that euen from the firſt day of her mariage, she began to pray like an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Anne, not for feare of barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, but for the glory of God, that it would pleaſe our Lord to ſend her a ſonne, that in ſome Religion might
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:19779:110"/>wholy dedicate himſelfe to his holy ſeruice. And ſo it ſeemed that God Almighty therfore vouchſafed to se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d her this Samuel, permitting him to haue a dangerous entrance into this world, that he might the ſooner marke him for his owne, with the character of Baptiſme, which by the Phiſitians aduiſe was giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him before he was halfe come forth of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wombe; but the danger of this paſſage at lenght by theinterceſſion of our B. Lady was taken away, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though for a ſpace there remayned ſome feare and doubt, whether he were aliue or dead. For he lay ſtill without mouing for the ſpace of an houre, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to shew that he was aliue, he gaue one little cry only, &amp; ſo gaue ouer, and neuer vſed to cry any more as other children are wont to doe; a preſage doubtleſſe of his future be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour and conditions, which were alwayes moſt gentle, mild, and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</p>
               <p>After his mother had brought him vp in all piety and feare of God, vnto
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:19779:110"/>the age of fiue yeares or thereabout, his Father deſiring to traine vp his ſonne in warlike affaires fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his very cradle, tooke him away with him to a towne called, <hi>Caſall the greater,</hi> in the Territory of Milan, where when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he muſtered his ſouldiers, he made him march before them in light armour, with a little ſpeare vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his shoulder. From hence the Marques his Father being to march with his army to Tunis a Citty in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frike, ſent Lewis backe to Caſtilion, where growing now towards ſeauen yeares of age, at which time children begin to haue diſcretion to diſcerne betweene good &amp; bad, he withdrew himſelfe by little and little from the conuerſation of ſouldiers, and began to apply himſelfe to the ſeruice of God, ſaying euery day at home vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his knees the prayers which are, <hi>The Daily Exerciſe,</hi> together with the ſeauen Penitentiall pſalmes, and the office of our Bleſſed Lady, with ſo great feruour and care that he neuer
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:19779:111"/>omitted the ſame were he neuer ſo ſicke: and was wont to call that, the time of his conuerſion.</p>
               <p>When the Marques came home, and ſaw his ſonnes warlike audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, changed into a pious and prudent modeſty, he reioyced exceedingly to ſee how wiſe and diſcret an heire he should haue to ſucceed him in the gouernement of his ſubiects. But Lewis his intentions were leuelled at a farre higher marke, which he was not afraid now and then to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify vnto his mother; who albeit she deſired nothing more, then that one of her ſonnes should become a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious man, yet was she halfe afraid to heare her eldeſt ſonne and heire, talke of taking that courſe of life, much more to perſuade him to it.</p>
               <p>Not long after, the Marques vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome occaſion going to viſit the Duke of Florence, tooke both Lewis and his younger brother with him; and there ſet them both to ſchoole, to the end, that in that Great Dukes court, they might not only learne
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:19779:111"/>good manners, but other ſciences alſo. Lewis at the age of nine yeares being left there by his father, began to exerciſe himſelfe in all kinde of vertues, eſpecially of Chaſtity and purity, wherof, out of the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion he had conceaued towards our Bleſſed Lady, he made a vow to keepe the ſame perpetually, before an Image of hers which the whole Citty hath in great deuotion. He heard Maſſe euery day, and beſides maſſe vpon holy dayes, he alwayes was preſent at Euenſong. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he knew not yet how to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate, yet the neuer let paſſe the dayly Exerciſe, and other Offices which we haHe ſpoken of before, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to ſay them euery morning, as ſoone as it was day. Heere finally he began to wayne himſelfe from all kinde of pleaſures, and paſtimes eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewing all conuerſation that might giue him occaſion to ſpeake the leaſt idle word; for he had now begun to frequent the Sacrament of Pennance
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:19779:112"/>with much feruour. And ſo euer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was wont to call Florence, the mother of his piety and deuotion.</p>
               <p>Two yeares being now paſt in Florence, Lewis and his brother ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their leaue of the great Duke, with Order from the Marques, went to liue at Mantua, where he came to take ſo great delight in abſtinence and faſting, which was for a time preſcribed him for the health of his body, that afterwardes to the great domage of the ſame, he could not be diſſuaded from vſing ſtill the ſame medicine for the good of his ſoule. Here now as he began to thinke with himſelfe, how he might make all his inheritance ouer to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and take vpon himſelfe an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall kind of life, being called home from the heates of Mantua at the age of twelue yeares, he receiued of our Lord the gift of prayer and contemplation, and by aduiſe of Saint Charles Borromeus Cardinall, then viſiting that Dioceſſe, he began
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:19779:112"/>to frequent the holy Communion, with exceeding great deuotion. But his ſtomacke now with praying and faſting was growne ſo weake, that he was ſcarce able to diſgeſt any meate at all. Wherfore his Father ſent for him to Montſerrat, to ſee if by any meanes he could draw him a little from that auſterity, that he might recouer his health. But Lewis there for the ſpace of halfe a yeare could take pleaſure in nothing but in his former exerciſes, vſing for his paſtime only to viſit holy places and Monaſteries, flying from the conuerſation of all but Religious me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by whoſe examples he was ſo ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficaciouſly moued, that he fully pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to take vpon him ſome Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious habit or other, although, being not yet full thirteene yeares old, he had not yet determined of what Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der he would be.</p>
               <p>In the meane time being returned home againe with his Father to Caſtilion, he went forward excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:19779:113"/>in all kind of vertues, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in extraordinary abſtinence and mortification. From hence not long after as he trauailed into Spaine in company of his Father, and other noble Italians, he neuer omitted his accuſtomed contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and holy Exerciſes. But he ſo behaued himſelfe for the ſpace of two yeares and more that he liued in the King of Spaines Court, that no Prouerbe was ſo much in the mouthes of the chiefeſt Coutiers, as that <hi>the yonger Marques of Caſtilion, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med not to be made of flesh and bloud.</hi> Such progreſſe had he made in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of all worldly honours and pleaſures.</p>
               <p>Heere how Lewis being at the age of fifteene yeares and an halfe began to feele in himſelfe ſo ardent a deſire of forſaking the world, that after many dayes, commending the matter to God Almighty in his prayers, it pleaſed his diuine Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty by a voyce from heauen, to giue
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:19779:113"/>him a particular vocation to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of Ieſus. Which thing his Ghoſtly Father vnderſtanding, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued his good intention, ſo that it might be put in execution with the Marques his Fathers leaue. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon Lewis hauing firſt told his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (who with a ioyfull hart ſoone offered vp her Samuel to gods holy ſeruice) without delay went vnto his Father, and with all humility and reuerence declared his mind vnto him. At which the Marques was ſo enraged, that he bad him ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther get him gone, and talke no more to him of any ſuch matter, or he would cauſe him to be whipt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently. To whome Lewis very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly anſwered: <hi>Would to God I might receaue ſuch a benefit, as to ſuffer that for his ſake,</hi> and ſo departed from him. And after a long triall by which he was vndoubtedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it was from God, and ſeeing his Father ſtill remayned inexora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he going one day to the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:19779:114"/>of the Society, (as at other times he was wont to doe,) to viſit the Fathers, he deſired his younger brother and the reſt of his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance that were with him, to goe their wayes home, and leaue him, for that he did not meane to ſtir one foot out of that place.</p>
               <p>Now, the Marques his Father ſeeing the firme reſolution of his Sonne, with much a doe perſuaded him not to enter into Religion in Spaine, but to ſtay till they retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned home into Italy, and that there he should haue his owne will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished. As ſoone as they were arriued in Italy, Lewis claimeth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of his Father, but he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king by that and other delayes, to make his vocation at length wax cold, anſwered that he could by no meanes condeſcend vnto his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, before that he and his brother, had ſaluted all the Princes of Italy. Which Lewis hauing performed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning home found his Father more
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:19779:114"/>obſtinate againſt him then euer he was before. In ſo much that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had indeuoured all he could, by meanes of diuers graue Bishops and Prelates to diſſuaded him from that courſe of life, finding at laſt to be true which a certaine Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall, whom amongſt others the Marques had ſent vnto him, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards confeſſed. <hi>Diaboli partes apurl hunc Adoleſcentem agendas mibi impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuerunt. Eas, quia neceſſe erat, quanto potui ſtudio &amp; ingenio ſuſtinui. Verum nec hilum profeci, ſtat immotus: percelli nequit.</hi> They made me play the deuills part and tempt this yong man with all the wiles and allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes which I could poſſibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. But I preuayled nothing. <hi>He ſtands altogether immoueable and inuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible: he cannot be daunied.</hi> After (I ſay) that the Marques ſaw the matter came to that paſſe hauing ſent for Lewis and examined him by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with an angry countenance, &amp; sharp words as he lay in bed ſicke of
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:19779:115"/>the goute, he biddeth him get him out of his ſight.</p>
               <p>But hearing, that his words had made him leaue the houſe &amp; recollect himſelfe in a Monaſtery of Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, he ſent for him home againe and did ſo bitterly reprehend him for it, that Lewis euery day, as one in great anguish and trouble of mind, to ſee his Father ſo to croſſe his holy intentions, caſting himſelfe downe proſtrate before a Crucifix with many teares and cruell diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines, began to act ſuch a bloudy Tragedy vpon himſelfe, as thoſe which beheld him thorough the chinkes of his doore, could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure ſo pittifull a ſight. In ſo much that the Marques himſelfe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieuing others report, being brought vnto the doore in his bed, and ſeeing it mith his owne eyes, was ſo amazed and moued to pitty, that without any more reſiſtance, he wrote vnto Scipio Gonzaga then Patriarch of Hieruſalem, to offer
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:19779:115"/>his Sonne vnto Father Claudius A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quauiua, Generall of the Society of Ieſus, who willingly accepted of him, and after admitted him by a letter, which was the anſwere to one that Lewis had familiarly before written vnto him, to thanke him for ſo great a benefit.</p>
               <p>But this was not the end of Lewis his perſecution; for the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques not content with employing him for nine monethes after, about certaine affaires at Milan, which Lewis, by reaſon of his Fathers ſicknes, and to giue him the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſatifaction he could, with no leſſe ſpeed then prudence diſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched; not content I ſay with this (when the writings and all were come, with letters patents from the Emeperour, ſo that Lewis ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to haue nothing elſe to doe but by deliuering the writtings to his brother to deſinherit himſelfe, and ſo depart in peace) he came to Millane, and rayſed another
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:19779:116"/>tempeſt againſt him, ſo much the more terrible, by how much he himſelfe (beſides many others) did ſundry tymes more earneſtly plead his owne cauſe before him, with ſuch ſpeeches as we may imagine the paſſionate affection of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ouerflowing with tender loue towards ſuch a ſonne, could affoard.</p>
               <p>But ſeeing all his labour to be in vaine, he cauſed himſelfe to be carried in a chaire into the houſe of the Society of Ieſus, and there ſending for a graue Father of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in that Citty, he declared the matter vnto him, concluding that he was determined to ſtand to his iudgement, vpon condition that he would there in his preſence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine his ſonnes vocation, and vrge him with all the reaſons he could deuiſe, to auert him from his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. To be short Lewis was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and the Father in all ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and with all ſeuerity ſet vpon
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:19779:116"/>him, and did the beſt he could. But Lewis gaue ſo good ſatisfaction to all the doubts and difficulties which were oppoſed againſt him, that the Father after great admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion burſt forth into this verdict: <hi>Aequum poſtulas, Domine Aloyſi, aequum poſtulas; néque dubium eſſ poteſt quin ſit vt dicis. Mihi quidem ſtimulos admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſts, neque vllum praeterta quaerendi lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum reliquiſti.</hi> Which is as much as to ſay, as that there could be no more doubt, but Lewis his petition was iuſt and reaſonable.</p>
               <p>The Marques alſo being for this time fully perſuaded to grant the ſame, returned home to Caſtilion, and Lewis preſently, (all thinges being put in good order,) followed him: and after he had with an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted courage paſſed one brunt more of his Fathers fury, at laſt taking his leaue of Caſt lion (all the people with many teares lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their owne loſſe, and excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſory for that they were not
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:19779:117"/>whorthy of ſo good and gracious a Lord) he departed with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Mantua: where in preſence of other Noble men that were to be witneſſes of the deede, hauing renounced his title of Marques, and caſt from him all other orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and toakens of that digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he went immediatly, and the ſame day put on the habit of the Society, which he had before pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and brought ready with him. And hauing ſpent a whole day in taking leaue of his father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the next morning he tooke his ioyfull iourney towardes Rome. He was ſcarce lighted from his horſe in Rome, when going immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the houſe of the profeſſed Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, he caſt himſelfe downe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate at the Generals feete, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing and acknowledging to be his Subiect. Then with his leaue, he went to viſite the holy places, to ſalute his friends, and other Princes there, and to receiue the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:19779:117"/>Popes benediction. All which being diſpatched, vpon Saint Catherine the Virgin and martyrs day, at the age of ſeauenteene yeares, eight monethes, and ſix dayes, he entred into the Nouiciate of the Society of Ieſus at S. Andrews in Rome, with as great ioy and iubily of heart, as if he had entred into a paradiſe of all delights and pleaſures, giuing immortall thankes to God, for brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him out of Aegypt, into that Land of Promiſe, flowing with milke and hony.</p>
               <p>Heere now Lewis hauing paſſed thorough all kind of exorciſes in Humility and Obedience, with great admiration of all, almoſt the ſpace of a yeare, was ſent to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to recouer his health, and to make an end of the courſe of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, which he had begun at Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan. But after halfe a yeare, finding by experience that that place, nor ayre agreede with his health, he was called backe againe to Rome, and
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:19779:118"/>ſent vnto the Romane Colledge, where he defended his Philoſophy publikly with great applauſe, and ſo proceeded to heare his higher courſes of diuinity. After he had liued now two yeares in the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, vpon Saint Catherines day, being the day on which firſt he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, he alſo made the three vowes of Pouerty, Chaſtity and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, as the cuſtome is. For albeit he had not ſpent all this time in the Nouiciate, yet God by his holy grace did ſo ſupply in his ſoule the want of that time, which the infirmity of his bodye tooke from him, that whereſoeuer he liued all his life after, he remayned ſtill as it were a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice.</p>
               <p>The next yeare vpon the eight abd twentith day of Ianuary, he began to take Eccleſiaſticall Orders, and by the 26. of Frebruary he had receaued one after another, vpon ſeuerall dayes, all thoſe which are called the Minores, or inferiour
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:19779:118"/>Orders. The yeare following, he was ſent to Caſtilion and Mantua, to compoſe certaine contentions and debates betweene his Brother the Marques (his Father being now deceaſed) and the Duke of Mantua, which if he had not, by the great authority, which for his ſanctity he alwayes had amongſt them, taken vp and decided, would haue coſt much bloudshed on both ſides.</p>
               <p>The next yeare he withdrew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, with order from his Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, to Milan, where it pleaſed God to reueale vnto him, that the houre of his death approached, with which reuelation he returned ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to Rome, with his thoughts ſo fixed on heauen, ſo dead to the world and to all worldly thinges, that he appeared rather as one dead, then liuing: his only ſight ſtirred vp deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in others, and his very wordes incited his hearers to the loue of God: In fine, he was in the eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:19779:119"/>of all, aliuely patterne of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p>In the yeare 1591. the Citty of Rome was ſorely viſited with a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, by reaſon of the multitude of poore people that were infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by a former famine, to repaire thither for to begge their ſuſtenance, at which time the Generall and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Society, inforcinge themſelues to the ayde and ſuccour of the poore, beſides the large almes that they daily procured for them, they laboured the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an Hoſpitall to relieue and cure the ſicke, which were in great number viſited, with ſundry dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and infectious diſeaſes, where thoſe of the Society attended them with great diligence and charity; of which number Lewis by much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity obtained of his Superiours to be one, where he ſerued the ſicke with wonderfull deuotion, humility, and charity, exerciſing himſelfe euer moſt willingly about thoſe that were
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:19779:119"/>the moſt loathſome and dangerouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infected. In this imployment, he together with many others of the Society, got that infection wherof afterwards he died, which he fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and knowing that our Lord was pleaſed to doe him that fauour, to deliuer him from the priſon of his body, and to take him to reſt, he reioyced exceedingly, giuing God moſt humble and harty thanks for ſo great a benefit, and the more, for calling him, in ſuch an age and before he was Prieſt, whereby he eſteemed himſelfe ſecure of rendring accompt, either for the vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble expence of many yeares, or the abuſe of ſo great a dignity. He made a generall Confeſſion, and hauing receaued his Viaticum, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Vnction, he attended the houre of his death: neuertheleſſe it pleaſed our Lord that the ſeauenth day of his ſickneſſe the fury of it ceaſed, and there remayned only a gentle feuer which held him three
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:19779:120"/>monthes, in all which time he neuer willingly entertayned diſcourſe of any thing but of heauen, and heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thinges, in ſo much that we may ſay (as it were) he had ſent his hart before him.</p>
               <p>He being by little and little ſore weakened by the feuer, it pleaſed our Lord to reueale vnto him the howre of his deceaſe: wherupon with great ſignes of ioy, he ſaid <hi>Te Deum laudamus,</hi> and tould thoſe that were about him, that he should dye on the Octaue of the feaſt of the Bleſſed Sacrament, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi> day, as alſo during the Octaue, he ſeemed ſo well to recouer, that on the Octaue day they ſaid vnto him. That he should rather thinke of his recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, then of his death that day, ſince there appeared no danger at all. To whome he quietly anſwered: <hi>The day is not yet paſt, I shall aſſuredly dye this night.</hi> The euening being come, the Prouinciall came to viſit him,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:19779:120"/>who demaunded of him how he did? Lewis anſwered. <hi>I goe Father.</hi> Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her ſaid the Prouinciall? <hi>To heauen</hi> (anſwered Lewis) <hi>I truſt by the great mercy of God, if my ſinnes doe not hinder me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pope Gregory the fourteenth, hearing that he was in the Agony of death, ſent vnto him his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, with a plenary Indulgence of all his ſinnes, and drawing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his end, he deſired earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to take a diſcipline, or at leaſt (by reaſon of his owne weakenes) that one might be giuen him vpon his backe: which being denyed, he humbly beſeeched leaue of Father Prouinciall that he might dye vpon the ground, ſo great was his fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and deſire of ſuffering, euen then when his ſickneſſe had rendred him almoſt incapable of ſufferinge. In briefe, after that he had taken leaue of the Fathers and Brothers of the Colledge with many teares, he entred into long and ſweet interiour
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:19779:121"/>Colloquies with our Lord, kiſſing often a Crucifix which he held in his handes, with his eyes ſixed thereon, and often calling vpon the holy name of Ieſus, he rendred his ſoule to reſt on Thurſday at night, being the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taue of the B. Sacrament, the one &amp; twentith of Iune, in the yeare of our Lord 1591. and in the three and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tith yeare of his age, three monthes and eleauen daies, after he had bene of the Society fiue yeares, and almoſt ſeauen monthes.</p>
               <p>He was interred in the Chutch of the Annuntiation in the Roman Colledge, with ſo great concourſe of people, not only of thoſe of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety and Schollers, but alſo from the Court and Citty of Rome, that not without great difficulty could his body be buried, euery one ſtriuing to kiſſe his handes, and for ſome relique of him; ſome cutting his haire, others his garments, others euen his fingers ends. He was put into a Coffin, and laid in the Chappell of the Crucifix,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:19779:121"/>and from thence in the yeare of our Lord 1598. he was remoued to a more eminent place of the ſame Church; finally the thirteenth day of May in the yeare 1605. he was ſolemnely tranſlated with muſicke, and lights, into the great Chappell of our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lady in the ſame Church, and there placed in the wall neere the right ſide of the Altar. This tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was cauſed by reaſon of the many miracles that it pleaſed out Lord to worke by him, in diuers places, and the multitude of people that came dayly to his Tombe to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer vp theire vowes, which excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly increaſed the deuotion of the people, and the concourſe to his B. Reliques; which was a thing ſo cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated at Rome, that Pope Paul the fifth, in the month of Septe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber 1607. gaue order, that an inquiſition might be made of his life and miracles for his Canonization.</p>
               <p>Among the many miracles that haue bene wrought by the interceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:19779:122"/>of Bleſſed Lewis, there be forty and foure approued and recorded, which he hath done in the State of Caſtilio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, his owne proper Countrey and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, where his Image is placed on an Altar with twelue lamps before it continually burning, beſides the other innumerable lights which the people daily offer vnto his honour, and before the ſame are hanged on the walles more then three hundred votiue Tablets, offered in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and for deuotion, of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</p>
               <p>Our Lord in diuers other places hath likewiſe shewed forth his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders by the meanes of this bleſſed Saint, rendring health to diuers dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly ſicke of feuers, and other diſeaſes, reſtoring the blind to ſight, the deafe to hearing, helping of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the perill of child-birth, with many others, which are all at large recorded in the Booke of his life, out of which I will only rehearſe briefly theſe few that follow.</p>

               <p>The Duke of Mantua, comming to Rome in the yeare 1605. viſited with great deuotion the tombe of his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Lewis, and had there giuen him (by his Brother Francis Gonzaga, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Embaſſadour for the Emperour) a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique of his, with which returning by Florence, to Mantua, he was taken with a grieuous paine in his knee, which had long &amp; ſorely vexed him, to which applying this holy Relique of B.

               <pb n="244" facs="tcp:19779:123"/>
               <p>He had likewiſe the guift of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy, &amp; foretould vnto his mother, that his Brother Francis (who was the youngeſt of his Brothers) should be the Rayſer vp and glory of their Houſe, which proued true; as likewiſe diuers other things which he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tould.</p>
               <p>Who ſeeth not in this life, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mireth not the bounty and liberality of our Lord, who had ſo filled with his grace, this Bleſſed young man, whome he made choiceof, euen from his mothers wombe, to render glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious both in heauen and earth? How great ſpirit in ſo young age, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection in ſo many troubles, what mortifications in the miedeſt of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and delightes, what humility in greatneſſe, what miſpriſe of all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thinges, and earneſt ſeeking after heauenly?

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:19779:124"/>yeares of age, together with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other of his Brothers, elder then he, to Vienna in Auſtria (where the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour Maximilian, at that time kept his Court) for to ſtudy there, in the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Fathers of the Society of Ieſus, which was at that time very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for the education of youth.</p>
               <p>Sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>niſlaus ſtudied ſo diligently there, being of an excellent wit, that he ſurpaſſed all the reſt of his School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellowes, of whome for his gentlenes &amp; modeſty he was generally beloued. Euery morning before he went to ſchoole, and euery euening after he came from ſchoole, he vſed to make his prayers in the Church of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. He auoyded all ill company, all conuerſation with Libertines, or any other thing that had not the odour of deuotion. With all diligence he was a great louer of ſilence, and neuer ſpake but what he had firſt well weighed &amp; conſidered. He was modeſtly cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and cheerfully modeſt, &amp; affable. He conuerſed moſt willingly with
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:19779:125"/>thoſe that were ſimple and ſincere: he was very compaſſionate, and ſuccoured to his power, all thoſe that were in neede or extremity: he was euer the firſt vp (of his ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellowes) in the morning: he conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not himſelfe with hearing one maſſe daily, nor on feaſts with fewer then all he could poſſibly heare. He went meanely cladde, and for all the cold ſeaſon (which in thoſe parts is very bitter in the winter) he neuer wore gloues, nor would euer vſe the helpe of any ſeruant, vnleſſe when he was commaunded by his maiſter, or brother. Almoſt all his Orations and Declamations that he made, in the exerciſe of Eloquence, were in the praiſe of the glorious Virgin Mary, to whome he was ſingularly denoted. He ſaid euery day his Beades: he prayed not only many times of the day, but would riſe in the night to pray (while his companions ſlept) accompanying his prayers with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers acts of humility and mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: he vſed ſundry times ſecretly to
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:19779:125"/>ſweep his brothers Chamber, faſted in priuate diuers daies, and with ſore diſciplines often chaſtized his tender body. And although his Brother ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> chid him for liuing ſo retired, yet he hauing his eyes fixed on God (who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all he deſired to pleaſe) would neuer omit his ordinary exerciſes and deuotions.</p>
               <p>Staniſlaus being thus vertuouſly imployed and diſpoſed, our Lord en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindles in him more and more the flames of his Ioue, &amp; inſpired him with a vocation to the Society of Ieſus; which he vowed although he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered not his reſolutions to any one, beſides his Confeſſour, vntill ſix mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes after.</p>
               <p>About that time he was viſited with a dangerous ſickneſſe, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of which, being in his Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, the diuell appeared vnto him in the shape of a great blacke dogge, horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and fearefull, who tooke him thrice by the throate, attempting to haue ſtrangled him: but he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:19779:126"/>himſelfe feruently to God, by his grace, with the ſigue of the Croſſe, chaſed him away, in ſuch ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that he neuer appeared after vnto him.</p>
               <p>His ſicknes had reduced him to ſuch extremity, that the Phiſitia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s had giuen him ouer: and the Bleſſed youth lay ſo afflicted, not ſo much for the death which he ſaw before his eyes, as becauſe he had no meanes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the Bleſſed Sacrament, which he exceedingly deſired, by reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the Hoſt of the houſe where he lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, was an Heretique. Wherfore he commended himſelfe earneſtly to our Bleſſed Sauiour, &amp; to S. Barbara, both becauſe she was Patroneſſe of the Schollers of the Colledge of Vie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, where he ſtudied, as alſo that he remembred to haue read in her life, that whoſoeuer that was deuoted vnto her should neuer die without the Sacraments of the Church. And for that the laſt time, which he had communicated, was vpon the ſeaſt of
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:19779:126"/>Saint Barbara aforeſaid, which is the fourth of December, he humbly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired of our Sauiour by the interceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that glorious Saint, that he might not yet depart this life, without firſt hauing receiued the Sacraments of the Church. And at that preſent fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelfe almoſt in the agony of death, he renewed this his petition with greater feruour &amp; earneſtneſſe; which our Bleſſed Sauiour granted. For being one night awake, langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing in the agony of death, he ſaw en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into his chamber the holy Virgin S.

Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, from whoſe ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des with wonderfull reuerence he receaued it, and began to be a little better.</p>
               <p>After this great fauour, he receaued another moſt ſingular, and no leſſe meruailous: for beinge ouercome with the violence of his ſickenes, and in the extremity of his life, our B. Lady appeared vnto him with the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:19779:127"/>child Ieſus in her armes, and with a gratious countenance and regard ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monishing him to enter the Society of Ieſus, she vanished away, leauing the child Ieſus, lying on the bed by him. Staniſlaus ayded by the celeſtiall fauour, ſodainly began to recouet his ſtrengt &amp; to amend, at which the Phiſitia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were aſtonished, as at a thing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to all rules of Phiſicke. Theſe two admirable fauours, B. Staniſlaus manifeſted a little before his death, to one of his fellow-Nouices, named Stephen, as alſo vnto Father <hi>Emanuel Sà,</hi> which notwithſtanding hauing done it at vnawares, he remayned ſo much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, that the teares ſtood in his eyes.</p>
               <p>Being now reſtored to perfect health, not vnmindfull either of the priuate vow that he had made to enter into the Society, or of the admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our B.

<pb n="253" facs="tcp:19779:127"/>meanes receaue him in the Colledge at Vienna, without the conſent of his friendes, and bleſſing of his Father. But he not willing to expect ſo long, and deſpayring to obtayne leaue of his Father; knowing likewiſe the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe nature of his Brother Paul, who had often times intreated him with bitter wordes, and ſometimes with blowes, which he euer had indured, with great patience and inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, for the loue of vertue; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witſtanding that he might haue ſome fit occaſion to put his good deſires in practiſe, he ceaſed not to giue many outward teſtimonies of his inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; &amp; one day he diſcouered it vnto his brother, who was thereat ſo much ince<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſed againſt him, that he rated him out of his prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, threatning to aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe his pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of his proceeding. But ſtill co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuing to appeaſe his Brother, &amp; to get at leaſt his good will, he ſpake vnto him one morning in very louing manner; who in a rage anſwered, that he should get him gone with a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:19779:128"/>chiefe whither he would.</p>
               <p>Staniſlaus, as an occaſion fitly ſent him from heauen, gladly imbraced what his Brother had ſaid, and ſo put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelfe in poore apparell, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing confeſſed and communicated, &amp; earneſtly commended himſelfe to God, and out B. Lady, tooke his iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney on foote from Vienna to Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burge, there to find Father Caniſius Prouinciall of Germany, to whome he had letters of commendations fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a Father of the Society, preacher to the Empreſſe <hi>Maria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So ſonne as Paul miſſed his brother, he was much afflicted, knowing that he principally by his choller and ill vſage had chaſed him away: he ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched diligently many Churches and Religious houſes in Vie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>na, but could heare no newes of him, vntill by an Hungarian Gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who had beene ſchool-fellow with Staniſlaus, and by a little note that he had written to his Tutour and left within a booke, his reſolution was knowne, and alſo the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:19779:128"/>way that he had taken. Wherfore his brother, with his ſaid Tutour, taking with them alſo their Hoſt and one ſeruant, followed him with all ſpeed in Coach, whome they ouertooke on the way, but it pleaſed God that they went on without knowing of him, &amp; shortly after by reaſon that the Coach-horſes were young and vnſit for trauaile, they were forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne without paſſing further.</p>
               <p>Staniſlaus now ſeeing himſelfe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered from this perill, was much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated and comforted: and paſſing on his way, he went one Sunday morning to a Church in a village, which he ſuppoſed to be Catholike, with a deſire to receaue the Bleſſed Sacrament: but perceauing to belong to Heretikes, he was much troubled, &amp; in his trouble had recourſe to our Lord, beſeeching him with teares in his eyes, that he might not be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of the food of his ſoule which he ſo much thirſted after. Our B. Sauiour vouchſafed to heare him and graunt

Sacrament, in the ſame manner as he had done before during his ſicknes, by the prayers of Saint Barbara.</p>
               <p>With this Celeſtiall food Staniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus, in short time ariued at Auſburge where not finding Father Caniſius, he went vnto Dibſinge a towne ten leagues from Auſburge, where the ſaid Father was, and where he was charitably intreated, and shortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with other two Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panions, ſent vp to Rome: and in the eighteenth yeare of his age, he arriued at his deſired port, and where after a moſt weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome iourney, for that he had trauay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> two hundred &amp; three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore leagues on foote, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued into the Society of Ieſus, by Father Francis Borgia, then Generall, vpon the eight and twentith day of October, being the feaſt of S. Simon
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:19779:129"/>and Iude, in the yeare of our Lord 1567.</p>
               <p>As ſoone as his Father vnderſtood that he was entred into the Society at Rome, he was liuely touched with ſorrow, becauſe according to flesh and bloud, he loued him deerely. Therfore he wrote vnto him a letter full of paſſion and threates. That he had dishonoured his Houſe and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily by the courſe he had taken, and that if euer he returned into Polonia, he would either force him from that ſtate of life, or ſend him to his graue; and that inſteed of thoſe riches, chaines of Gold, &amp; Iewells that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to bequeath him, if he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned in the world; he would load him with captiuity, and chaines of iron.</p>
               <p>Staniſlaus anſwered this letter with great humility and modeſty, and with no leſſe courage and conſtancy, that he was moſt vnworthy to ſuffer for God, who had ſuffered ſo much for man: yet neuertheleſſe if it should
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:19779:130"/>pleaſe God to be ſo bountifull vnto him, there could not happen any thing more deſired by him, then euen to die for the teſtimony of thoſe vowes, that he had made &amp; promiſed to God.</p>
               <p>He gaue alſo inceſſant thankes to God euen with floudes of teares, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaw himſelfe in the Nouiciate, free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the moleſtations of pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, in the aſſured port of religion, hauing eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the ſtormes and dangers of the world, he thought of no other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but what he had in heauen, nor of other mother then the bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin: he contemplated all his fellow Nouices as Saints, to the end to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate their vertues, and eſteemed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe farre vnworthy to liue among ſuch Angells, and to be imployed (by the great fauour and mercy of God) in the ſeruice of them, that were his moſt deuout and profitable ſeruants. He was truly humble, and well inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the knowledge of himſelfe: his deſire to be deſpiſed, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:19779:130"/>cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted of (for the loue of Chriſt) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in his poore habit, his earneſt ſeeking for the moſt abiect and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Offices of the houſe: he alwayes rankt himſelfe with the laſt, accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting euery one much more worthy then himſelfe. When he was at Vie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>na before his entrance into the Society, he gaue himſelfe ſo much to prayer, that by reaſon of his long continua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion, his heart and ſenſes had often fayled him, in ſuch ſort that not without diuers remedies, he hath bene brought vnto himſelfe againe. And if this Bleſſed Youth did ſo apply himſelfe to prayer and deuotion, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in the world, how much more did he excell, being now ſecure in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion? This only may ſuffice, that he did not only ſpend in prayer all thoſe houres of the day in which he was not otherwiſe imployed, but alſo the moſt part of the night, reſeruing only ſo much for ſleepe as would hardly ſerue to ſuffice na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <pb n="260" facs="tcp:19779:131"/>
               <p>By his long exerciſe and cuſtome to pray attentiuely, he had obtained ſuch a particuler guift of our Lord, that the Maiſter of the Nouices, and his Confeſſour haue affirmed, that he had neuer any diſtractions in prayer: ſo perfectly had he ſubdued his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination to his will. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any one complayned of diſtractions or wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring thoughts in prayer. Staniſlaus wondred at it, as a moſt ſtrange thing vnto him: nor was he only ſo vnited vnto God in prayer and meditation, but alſo in his exteriour and domeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call workes, which he performed with ſuch recollection, that it was eaſy to ſee, that no outward thing could trouble the inward quiet of his mind, nor attention of his ſpirit; which was increaſed in him to ſuch perfection, that in time of prayer many of the Nouices would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to pray where they might ſee him; for in behoulding him they lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to compoſe themſelues, and were incited to an extraordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:19779:131"/>of ſpirit. Many repayred vnto him in their troubles and tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, recommending themſelues vnto his prayers, by which meanes diuers were deliuered from ſundry tentations, and reſtored to quietnes of ſpirit.</p>
               <p>One time a Brother of the Society of Ieſus, who is now a Prieſt, being aſſaulted with a great and vehement tentation of auerſion from a Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, communicated the ſame with Staniflaus (who at that time ſerued in the Kitchin) deſiring him to pray to God that he would grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t him grace to ouercome it. Staniſlaus preſently went into the Church, and by his prayers obtained his preſent deliuery from that tentation. He had the great guift of teares, which he shad in great aboundance with a mernai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſweetnes of ſpirit: &amp; our Bleſſed Sauiour had illuſtrated him by his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine light, with ſuch a knowledge of ſpirituall things, that euery one ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired to ſee ſo much prudence, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:19779:132"/>and ſpirit in ſo young a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice.</p>
               <p>Our Lord had beſtowed diuers great and celeſtiall guifts and conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations on his B. Soule, whereby he became ſo inflamed with the diuine loue, that diuerſe times with the force and feruour therof, he ſell into extaſy out of which they could not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times recall him, without applying to him of linnen dipped in cold water, wherby in short time his health was much impayred. But who can imagin the ſingular deuotion that he had to the ſacred Queene of Heauen, being diſſolued in ſweetnes of mind as often as he thought vpon her admirable vertues: &amp; it ſeemed that both night &amp; day he had no other care, but how to ſerue her, and meditate vpon the myſteries of her holy life. For his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to her was ſo arde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in his breſt, that it could not be contained from diſcouering it ſelfe, by his words, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting her often, ſpeaking alwayes of her graces and vertues, making euen
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:19779:132"/>whole nights moſt amorous Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies with her, whome he euer vſed to call his mother.</p>
               <p>This deuotion of Staniſlaus to our bleſſed Lady, was ſo notable among the Nouices, that they to content him when they were together, would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes hould diſcourſe of the praiſes, priuiledges and excellencies of this moſt excellent Virgin; and for his ſake the Maiſter of the Nouices or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned, that both at riſing in mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, going to bed, and likewiſe at night after letanies, all the Nouices should, kneeling towards the Church of <hi>S. Maria Maior</hi> (which is ſcituated in Rome, neere to the Nouitiate of S. And rews) ſalute the B. Virgin, demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d her benediction, and deſire her to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour &amp; protect all thoſe that deſired to enter into the Society. This deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he bare to the Bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, made him deſire to die the Eue of her glorious aſſumption, which he long before foretold should be grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him.</p>
               <pb n="264" facs="tcp:19779:133"/>
               <p>What shall I ſay of the other rare and ſingular vertues, which, as from the liuely fountaine of the diuine li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality, filowed plentifully in his ſoule? And of his ſo entiere and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Obedience, that he neuer found repugnance in any thing that was commaunded him: he obeyed the voyce of his Superiour as the voyce of God, and had euer a perfect co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of will with his.</p>
               <p>What shall I ſay of his ſweetnes &amp; affability, or of his Compaſſion, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty and ſilence, of the rigorous and auſtere mortifications with which he afflicted his body, by faſts, diſcipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and hairecloth, as if he had beene a moſt grieuous ſinner, it being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine by the report of his Confeſſour, that in his life he had neuer ſinned mortally, &amp; that often in his ordinary Confeſſions, he could not find him culpable of any ſinne, for which to giue him abſolution. In briefe all the Nouices beheld him as a mirrour &amp; modell of the Society, &amp; the Maiſter
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:19779:133"/>of the Nouices would exhort them to imitate his example. All thoſe which freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted him familiarly, eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him as a ſoule particularly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by God, rich of vertues &amp; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, &amp; euen in behoulding him they were enflamed in the feare and loue of God.</p>
               <p>Staniſlaus thus rich in vertues, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing made ſo great a progreſſe in ſo few dayes of his Nouiceship, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed with the diuine loue and deſire to honor the Bleſſed Virgin in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, humbly beſeeched our Lord to take him from hence, into his kingdome, that he might ſee and enioy his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious preſence: which petition our Lord graunted him, as followeth. The Eue of Saint Laure<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, he meditaring of his martyrdome, with a feruent deſire to imitate him, &amp; to be burned in the liuely flames of the loue of God, demaunded of the reſt of the Nouices, who were all the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aſſembled, how one might burne and ſuffer for Ieſus Chriſt in the imitation of Saint
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:19779:134"/>Laurence? Euery one ſaid his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; to which he anſwered, that he would ſuffer ſome mortification in honour of that bleſſed Saint, to the end that he might pray for him vnto the B. Virgin his Mother, to take him quickly out of this exile, and that he might be preſent in heauen at the celebration of her Glorious Aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. To this intention he made a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique diſcipline in the refectory on his knees, could his fault, kiſſed the feete of euery one, begged his meate, and eate it on the ground. From thence he went to ſerue in the kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin, where by occaſion of the fier that he ſaw, he contemplated the torment of Saint Laure<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce on the Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diron, with ſuch vehemency and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, that his ſpirits languished &amp; ſenſes fayled him: In that manner he was carried to his bed, and was fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to haue a feuer, which althought at the beginning it was light, and the Phiſitians ſecure of any danger, yet Staniſlaus told the Rector, that for
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:19779:134"/>certaine he should not liue, nor euer riſe from his bed.</p>
               <p>So he began to decline dayly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his end, which when he felt approaching, he deſired that they would ſuffer him to dye vpon the ground. He was taken with a great flux of bloud, and there vpon enſued a cold feuer. Hauing receyued the bleſſed Sacraments of the Altar, and of Extreme Vnction, moſt deuoutly he fixt his eyes on heauen, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned a ſmall ſpace, with his thoughts rauished and lifted vp to God, vntill the Rector demaunded of him, if he were reſigned into the hands of our Lord, &amp; prepared eyther to liue or die, according to his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. To which he anſwered cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully: <hi>My God, my hart is ready.</hi> Then hauing louingly imbraced all thoſe that came to ſee him, he imbraced alſo an image of our bleſſed Lady which he had euer held moſt deare: he ſaid ſome prayers propre for the time, and made a Colloquy in Latin
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:19779:135"/>vnto the Crucifix which was before his eyes, thanking out Lord with his whole heart for all his benefits &amp; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies beſtowed vpon him, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him for the merites of thoſe bleſſed woundes of his feete, his handes, his ſide, and head, which he often kiſſed, to pardon him all his ſinnes, and to receaue his ſoule into his bleſſed hands in peace.</p>
               <p>The B. Virgin Mother of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared vnto him, accompanied with diuers other Virgins, to whome he ſpake a long time, and a little after with a ſweet ſilence he deliuered his ſoule into the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of his Creatour, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ninth houre of the night, the 14. day of Auguſt 1568. the 19. yeare of his age, and ſixt moneth of his Nouiceship, hauing with few dayes labour, obtayned as many crownes &amp; merits, as others perhaps in many yeares.</p>
               <p>His body remained ſo fayre, his cheekes ſo ruddy, his eyes ſo cleere, as one would haue thought him li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:19779:135"/>It was obſerued, that during his ſicknes (except when he was ſpoken vnto) his eyes were alwayes cloſed, although he were awake; and when vpon any occaſion he opened them, he lifted them vp towards heauen, with a ſmiling countenance, as if he had beheld ſome pleaſing obiect. His body was put in a Coffin (which was extraordinary, but graunted to him in particuler by reaſon of the great opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his ſanctity) in the Church of the Nouiciate of Saint Andrews, he being the firſt of the company that was there enterred. There came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch multitudes of people to kiſſe his feete, that Doctor Tollet, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward Cardinal, was amazed, therat, and ſaid: <hi>Is it not a ſtrange thing, that all Rome should run to reuerence the body of a yenge Polacke Nouice, as a Saint?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The opinion of his ſanctity much more increaſed, by a booke written in Italian of his life, printed in Rome two yeares after his death, wherein
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:19779:136"/>he was ſtyled Bleſſed; and in Polonia the ſame was written in Latin, where it was ſo frequent &amp; affectuous, that many only with reading therof haue bene incited to enter into the ſame Society. Preſently after his portraic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was painted in Polonia, and his pictures were ſet vp publikely with the tittle of Saint, and reuerenced not only by the vulgar, but euen by the Bishops, Prelats, Palatines, Lords, &amp; alſo by the King himſelfe, who placed the ſame amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the rank of Saints pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures in his Pallace, vpon the feaſt of S. Michaell the Archa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gell, in the yeare of our Lord 1604.</p>
               <p>Some of his reliques being carried to the twone of Gallici in the yeare 1602. were receaued there with a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne proceſſion, and kiſſed with great deuotion by all the people. Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the eight, (who had bene legate in Polonia before he was Pope,) grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out two Breues, in one whereof he beatified Staniſlaus, and in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, graunted ſix yeares, and ſix qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentens

His body is ſtill honored at Rome with great ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration and concourſe of people: &amp; in the yeare of our Lord 1605. the fourteenth day of Auguſt, Pope Paul the fifth hauing peruſed the Su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mary of his life &amp; miracles, permitted that his Picture might be publiquely ſet vp neere vnto his Tombe, with lights burning before it, and the memories and votiue Tables of the miracles, which our Lord had wrought by his interceſſion, to be there likewiſe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliquely hunge vpon the walles: the which was done with a wonderfull &amp; extraordinary co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>courſe of people, both fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Citty &amp; Court of Rome, the King of Polonia his Embaſſadour being preſent; &amp; the Sunday follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Bishop of Seruia ſunge Maſſe at his body, aſſiſted by the forſaid Embaſſadour of Polonia, and other of the Nobility of Poland, that were
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:19779:137"/>then in Rome.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe in Polonia in diuers Churches, maſſe was publiquely ſaid in his Commemoration, where the Altars were richly adorned with his Reliques, and Images placed theron: diuers rich guiftes and preſents were ſent from Polonia, and other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes to adorne his Tombe &amp; Altar in Rome, which are viſited euery day with ſingular deuotion, by reaſon of the many miracles that it hath pleaſed our Lord to worke by his interceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in diuers places of Europe.</p>
               <p>Many praying at his ſepulcher, haue felt a moſt ſweet odour to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from his body, which being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened a long time after his death, his ſaid body was found entire without any corruption at all. The miracles that it hath pleaſed our Lord to worke by this his ſeruant are very many, &amp; at large ſet downe in the booke of his life, out of which theſe few that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, are briefly taken forth.</p>
               <p>In the Prouince of Ruſia, a venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:19779:137"/>Prieſt being grieuouſly ſicke, B. Staniſlaus appeared vnto him, with two other Saints, aſſuring him that they shortly should meete all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: vpon which the Prieſt, who was much deuoted vnto him, was greatly comforted and shortly after died.</p>
               <p>One that was poſſeſſed by the diuell at Rome, &amp; exceedingly tormenred with euill ſpirits, was deliuered by the interceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of B. Staniſlaus. A cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Lady in Frence, being become lame and impotent, by reaſon of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine poiſon that had ben giuen her, deſired to be carried in a chaire to a certaine Church, where humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching our Lord by the merits of B. Staniſlaus, to reſtore vnto her her health and ſtrength, she was ſodainly healed, and riſing from her chaire, in the ſight of many people, she walked alone, to the wonder &amp; aſtonishment of all that were preſent, eſpecially of the Phiſitians who had long before eſteemed her incurable.</p>
               <pb n="274" facs="tcp:19779:138"/>
               <p>Diuers other wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue ben ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured by his interceſſion in their trauayles of Childbirth; others haue ben deliuered from feuers, ſwellings, blindnes: many broken legges and armes haue ben made whole, &amp; many diſeaſes almoſt incurable, healed. By drinking a little wine wherein one of his bones had ben ſteeped, one was cured of a dangerous ſicknes. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was cured by the touch of one of his teeth, and by other his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques, diuers others. At Rome in the yeare 1602, a Gentleman of Poland viſited with a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall feuer, deſired a certaine Prieſt to pray vnto B. Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſlaus for his recouery, who with great confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, in the name of God commaunded the feuer, by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of that B. Serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his, to depart and no more afflict the Gentleman, which God by his interceſſion effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and the Gentleman was ſodain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſtored to his health.</p>
               <p>For theſe, and diuers other reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, by which it hath pleaſed
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:19779:138"/>God to shew forth the Sanctity of his Seruant Staniſlaus, his ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher or shrine is wunderfully fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented and reuerenced at Rome, and adorned by the piety of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout people, with ſo many orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and riches, that of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the remarquable and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable thinges to be ſeene at Rome, this is reckoned for one. He was of ſmall ſtature, his haire blacke, of faire complexion, full faced: he alwayes looked cheerfully, and was of a pleaſing compoſition of body, &amp; of ſo rare and ſingular modeſty, that the only beholding of his face, did moue others to deuotion, and purity of life.</p>
               <p>His holy life is of very great eſteeme, and read with admiration both in France, Italy, Flaunders, Bohemia, Germany, Polonia, and Spaine (wherof this is only an abrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement) the which whoſoeuer shall peruſe attentiuely, shall find full of rare examples of vertue, and learne

               <p>From the firſt day that this holy Brother bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſerue God in the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of Ieſus, he made a firme reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to ſerue him with great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and therfore he beſought his diuine maieſty, that he would be pleaſed to exerciſe him in continuall paines and trauailes. He was ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in all kind of vertues, that he was a perfect modell and patterne of the ſame. He was ſo humble, that he eſteemed himſelfe the greateſt ſinner in the world; and though he knew by reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that he should be ſaued, without going to Purgatory, yet was he wont to weepe for his ſinnes; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did any thing ſo grieue him, as when he ſaw himſelfe eſteemed by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dring how any body could endure to treate with ſo baſe and vile a creature; ſuch was his opinion of himſelfe. He was very notable in mortification both exteriour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour, ſeeking in euery thing, that which was moſt repuguant to ſenſe
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:19779:140"/>&amp; fenſuall appetite, as well in diſtaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meates, which if they were by chance giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, he eate in great haſt leaſt they should be changed, as alſo in other pennances and corporall mortifications, faſtinges, wearing of hairecloth, and the like: and euen in theſe latter yeares wherin he hath benevery ſickly, to haue deſired leaue he might not omit any faſting dayes, beſides that euery weeke he vſed to take three diſciplines, during the time of his infirmity.</p>
               <p>He was ſo giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t prayer, that he paſſed many ho wers of the night, and the whole day in continuall prayer, in ſo much that his exteriour exerciſes, did not any way interrupt it; giuing ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t teſtimony by his rare modeſty, and ſingular good carriage, how feruent his prayers were, ſo that he neuer loſt the preſence of God, not for one minute.</p>
               <p>His obedience was ſo rare, as you shall hardly find more perfect in theſe our times. For tryall wherof
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:19779:141"/>being once bid by his Superiour to goe into the Indies, the word was ſcarcely ſpoken, but he was preſently ready to haue put it in execution, if the Porter would haue opened the dore. And the Rectour demaunding afterwards of him, how he thought to haue gone, not hauing either pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion or commodity of shiping? he anſwered that he went with great confidence in God, whome his Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour repreſented, and who would prouide him of all things neceſſary, &amp; that if he had not found the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of a ship, relying vpon holy O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, he would haue aduentured to haue gone vpon the ſeas. He shut a doore (through which he had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to paſſe) almoſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually, euery time he paſſed, for the ſpace of many yeares, becauſe his Superiour had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him once why he did notshut it.</p>
               <p>Another time the good Brother being ſicke of a vehement ague, the Rectour diſcourſing with him of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall matters as his manner was, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him, if his head did not trouble
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:19779:141"/>him? whereu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to he anſwered, that it did. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſaid the Rectour vnto him, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther talke no more; which he ſo punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually obſerued, that he ſpaken or one word all that night, thou the infirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did aske him many queſtions. He continuated in the ſame manner the next day, and when the Infirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian tould him he might well anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were, becauſe it was a neceſſary mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; he ſaid, not without leaue of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Rectour: hereupon the Rectour was called, and the Brother began to ſay: If your Reuerence will giue me leaue, I will anſwere the Infirmarian and Phifitian when they aske me any thing. The Rectour asked him why he did not anſwere before? Becauſe, ſaid he, your Reuerence yeſterday, bad me ſpeake no more.</p>
               <p>He had a great zeale of ſoules, yet alwayes conformable to his eſtate, for by his ſpirituall talke, his mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and good example, he continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preached, being Porter of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Maiorca, for the ſpace of 30.
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:19779:142"/>yeares, with vertuous reputation at home, and edification abroad. He hath done admirable things in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion of ſoules, ſtirring vp all thoſe who treated with him, to great deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and holines of life. He was very carefull to pray continually for the conuerſion of the whole world, and that with ſo great feruour of mind, that he did offer himſelfe to endure the paines of hell for all eternity, for gayning the ſoule of one poore Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, or ſlaue, if God were pleaſed therewith. And once or twice God did ſo eleuate him in ſpirit, that he faw and knew all the men &amp; women in the world, and reuealed vnto him, that by thoſe godly deſires of his, he did merit as much as if he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted all that multitude.</p>
               <p>Concerning his modeſty; there was no man that euer ſaw him to haue ſwarued from the leaſt point of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: he went with his eyes ſtill fixed on the ground, without caſting them any way, ſo that for the ſpace of
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:19779:142"/>40. yeares, he neuer looked any wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the face, though he vſually gaue wine to the Communicants after receauing the B. Sacrament at Maſſe. He was ſo giuen to ſilence, that albeit he conuerſed all his life both with domeſticalls and ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gets, yet he is not knowne to haue ſpoaken the leaſt idle word. He delighted much to talke of God, and if others did happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to talke of others matters, he preſently fell a ſleepe. He ſpake of ſpirituall things with ſo much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, that many perſons of this Iland, came of purpoſe to treate with him about their ſpitituall affaires, and to aske his aduiſe in their doubtes. By frequent co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſation with Almighty God, he had attayned to ſo great and height of ſpirituall knowledge, that he left ſome Bookes written with his owne hand, in which he ſpeaketh ſo excellently of vertues, that he farre ſurpaſſeth many learned men, writing of the ſame ſubiect. By reaſon wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Vice-roy of this Iland, Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:19779:143"/>Counſellours, Magiſtrats, Knights and gentlemen, had ſuch an opinion of his wiſedome, that they would not vndertake any buſines of importance, without his aduiſe: to whome he gaue great ſatisfaction, &amp; by his plaine and pious diſcourſes diſmiſſed them, with aſſured hope of the good ſucceſſe of their buſines, which was neuer fruſtrated if they obſerued his counſell. His pouerty was ſo extraordinary, that he was neuer content but when he tryed ſome effects therof. He was ſorry when the worſte things of the houſe were not giuen him. If he found but a pin, he would not keepe it without leaue. He deſired conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to feele ſome want both in his dyet, and apparell, lodging and the like.</p>
               <p>It could not be, but that he who was ſo carefull ouer his ſenſes, should haue attayned vnto ſuch angelicall purity, as Saint Ignatius his Father required in thoſe of the Society, both
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:19779:143"/>of body and minde. And therfore he neuer looked any man in the face, but he wept moſt bitterly for a good while after; which he did all his life time, for hauing once caſt his eye by chance vpon a coach paſſing by. To be briefe, by his practiſe of all ſortes of vertue, he ſeemed rather to be an Angell then a man: for not only in theſe later yeares, but for 40. yeares together, he hath not bene noted to haue done any thing, not only not imperfectly or according to his owne humour, but ſo that it might ſeeme to be done moſt perfectly: in ſo much that although the whole world, and the forces of hell it ſelfe should haue oppoſed againſt him, he would not haue ceaſed to doe that which was moſt perfect, and for the greater glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, which he had continually in his mouth, and much more in his heart. He was ſo punctuall in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of his Rules, that he would rather haue bene cut in peeces then breake the leaſt of them. He did ſo
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:19779:144"/>hate ſingularity that euen in theſe later yeares wherin he was ſubiect to infirmitys, he could not endure to ſit at the table of the Conualeſcentes, or ſuch as were weake, and in recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of their health, much leſſe to haue any particular thing brought him. Many haue conceyued ſo great an opinion of him, that they would willingly haue paſſed the ſeas, only to haue ſeene him: and many great men both Secular and Eccleſiaſticall, were wont to come to the Colledge, and ſtay there ſometime, only to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe with him, who went away aſtonished with his readines in anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wering at the gate, ſatisfying of all which came, with his good carriage, ſweet anſwers, and diligence in his Office.</p>
               <p>Thus going on, and mounting by degrees, he came at laſt to that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of loue towardes almighty God, that if his diuine Maieſty had notin a manner by miracle preſerued him, he had died through the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:19779:144"/>of his loue, as himſelfe hath left written, and alſo deliuered in giuing an account of his conſcience to his Superiour, which his rule com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth twice a yeare. And to the end thoſe things may be more aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, he hath for theſe ten yeares paſt, by order of his Superiours, giuen the account of his conſcience in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
               <p>He had great coniunction with the Angells and Saints, with whome he conuerſed both in heauen and earth, and eſpecially with 24. of the more principall, amongſt whome he deuided the 24. houres to treate and recommend himſelfe vnto them; wherin he neuer fayled, though in the night and in his ſleepe, awaking duly at the beginning of euery houre, to performe his accuſtomed deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion: which diligence of his, our Sauiour recompenſed, by diſcouering vnto him his glory, wherin he ſaw more perfectly, and knew all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

<pb n="288" facs="tcp:19779:145"/>as if he had conuerſed with them all his life time. From his very infancy he bare ſo extraordinary and tender deuotion towards the Bleſſed Virgin, at whoſe hands he receiued many fauours, that one time diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing and recreating as it were with her, he ſaid: O Queene of heauen, I loue thee more then my ſelfe, I loue thee more then thou loueſt me. The motherly affection of the Bleſſed Virgin could hould no longer, but appearing preſently, she made anſwere vnto him, No, no, Alpho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſus, it is not ſo, I loue the more then thou loueſt me. His familiarity with the Bleſſed Virgin and her So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne was ſuch, as is wont to be betweene friends, one to another, or as of a little child with his father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and indeed he eſteemed them for ſuch, who affoarded him often their corporall preſence, he ſpake vnto them (but once eſpecially when they entred into his heart) with ſuch deuotion &amp; ſweetnes, that he cauſed
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:19779:145"/>the ſame effectinall thoſe that did heare him, whome he exhorted wholy to forget themſelues, &amp; only to delight in his ſweet Louers, Ieſus and Mary, for ſo he was wont to call them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would be carefull both of body and ſoule.</p>
               <p>For 40. yeares together he dayly ſaid the Office of the Immaculate Conception of our Bleſſed Lady, to which myſtery he was much deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: and the Bleſſed Virgin one day tould him, that she was very much pleaſed with his deuotion; which he did exhort all the Society dayly to practiſe, telling them that one of the principall reaſons of the Inſtitution of the Society, was to preach and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Immaculate Conception of our Bleſſed Lady. And this he ſaid with ſo great affection, that he neuer vſed the like feruour: therby aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them that he ſpake it nor of himſelfe, but had recaued it by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation from heauen. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall vſe of his beades, as was
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:19779:146"/>found after his death, had cauſed an extraordinary hardnes in his fingars ends.</p>
               <p>I omit an infinite number of things which might be ſaid of his rare vertues, of his admirable lights and diuine fauours, remitting the Reader to the hiſtory of his life (which without doubt is one of the moſt rare and perfect amongſt the liues of thoſe Saintes, which haue receaued extraordinary fauours from almighty God) and will briefly recount his laſt ſicknes, death, and buriall, though from the very beginning of the 47. yeares which he liued in the Colledge of Maiorca, our Lord exerciſed him in all ſortes of paines, as well diuers perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the diuell which vexed him for many yeares, as corporall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities &amp; grieuous ſicknes wherwith he viſited him from time to time; yet he ſeemeth to haue made choice of the laſt 7. yeares, wherin, beſides thoſe infirmities which ordinarily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company old age, he began to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:19779:146"/>troubled with the ſtone, which cauſed him to keepe his bed continually; and the three laſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes of his life, to lye only vpon one ſide, being not able to turne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. He ſpent all his time in prayer, begging earneſtly of almighty God, not that he would mitigate or take away his paines, but rather he would augment them, and lay vpon him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers more grieuous.</p>
               <p>His ordinary complaints in his ſicknes were, that there was too much care had of him, who deſired rather altogether to be forgot or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted, as a carion or dead beaſt. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Rectour once bad him take a few conſerues, of ſweetmeates to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte him, he anſwered: <hi>Belieue me Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thoſe ſweet things are paines vnto me, and theſe paines ſweetnes,</hi> which he v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually alſo anſwered to thoſe who asked him how he did. By reaſon of great familiarity and conuerſation with his Father and mother Ieſus &amp; Mary, he ſpake vnto them with great
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:19779:147"/>affection thoſe wordes which he had learned of our Sauiour himſelfe. <hi>O Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus and Mary, my only comforts, grant me that I may ſuffer and die for your loue,</hi> and that, I <hi>may be wholy yours, and not mine owne.</hi> Once when he could ſcarcely ſpeake, the Infirmarian asking what troubled him, he anſwered. <hi>Nothing but ſelfe loue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some few dayes before his happy death, he was taken with ſuch a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement ague, that renewing all his paines, it ſeemed God would take him away within one houre, in which time he did nothing but repeate theſe wordes: <hi>Yet more good Lord, yet more.</hi> Therfore he receaued the B. Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (which for many yeares he had receaued twice a weeke) for his Via<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticum, with his accuſtomed deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as alſo the Sacrament of Extreme Vnction, ſtill begging of God with inuincible patience, to increaſe his paines. He bare ſuch extraordinary reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to the Fathers, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he could ſcarce ſtirre his armes, yet he would
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:19779:147"/>alwayes, when any came to him, pull off his night cap. Vpon Saturday in the euening being the 29. of October, almighty God performing that which he had promiſed him before, he fell into an extaſy, much like to thoſe which he had diuers times the yeare before, in which he perſeuered the three laſt dayes of his life. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his ſicknes had disfigured his body, yet after his extaſy, he became as beautifull as an Angell, and as red as a Roſe, which were certaine proofes of the great flame which burned in his breſt, &amp; brake out by thoſe exteriour ſignes, and exclamations which he vttered from time to time, <hi>O ſweet Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, O my deare mother,</hi> and the like. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ten a clocke in the night, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing giuen ſome ſigne of death ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, all the houſe came vnto him, &amp; they ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> repeating the name of Ieſus, and giuing him a Crucifix to adore, he preſently opened his eyes, which for three dayes before he had kept shut, and looking vpon the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifix,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:19779:148"/>they perceaued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be more quicke and liuely then when he was in beſt health. And with this, kiſſing the feete of the Crucifix, and ſaying <hi>O ſweet Ieſus,</hi> he gaue vp the Ghoſt, the Eue of All-Saints about mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night in the yeare of our Lord 1617.</p>
               <p>The rare vertue of this holy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was in ſuch eſteeme, that not only thoſe of this Prouince, but alſo thoſe of Italy, Caſt le, And aluſia, Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall, and the Indies, haue ſent to Maiorca, with earneſt intreaty for ſome of his Reliques. Many wrote vnto him, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mending themſelues to his prayers, &amp; only to haue his name written with his owne hand, as graue Eccleſiaſticall and Secular men, Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemen of great note, Grandies of Spaine, &amp; Cardinalls Vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the report of his death the whole Citty came flocking to kiſſe his hands, &amp; feete, and among others the Viceroy with all the Nobility and kings officers, the Eccleſiaſticall, and Religious me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:19779:148"/>After dinner his body was carried into the Church, &amp; with much adoe to paſſe through the preſſe of people, it was laid vpon a hearſe. All the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Orders came to ſing the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the dead, the Dominicans, Mercedes, Franciſcans, Auguſtines, Trinitarians, Minimes, with their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious and Prouincialls: as alſo the whole Chapter of Chanons, and all the Prieſts &amp; Paſtours of the towne. Incredible it is to one that did not ſee it, what a multitude there was of thoſe who came to touch his body with their beades, or to get ſome little peece of his garment for Reliques, &amp; of ſicke folkes who came to touch him; in ſo much that ſixe of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and two Fathers of S. Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicke who affoarded their helpe, were not ſufficient to reach the beades and meddalls, wrapped in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dkerchiffes, and throwne by the people that could not come neere, to haue them touch his body.

                  <pb n="296" facs="tcp:19779:150"/>there was made a short Sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only to declare vnto the people ſome few par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of his life, during which time, no man preſumed to couer his head in preſence of the holy Corps, though the Church was as full as it could thruſt; &amp; all as deuout and ſilent, as if there had beene no man there.</p>
               <p>The next day, being Friday, he was moſt ſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nely interred in the Church of the Society, wherat the foreſaid Viceroy, Nobility, Eccleſiaſticall &amp; Regular were againe preſent, as alſo the Lord Bishop, who the day before was ſicke and could not be preſent. The Maſſe was ſong with Organs, muſicke, and other ſignifications of deuotion. At the ſame inſtant that he was carried to be buried, a yong man who by reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a thin skinn couering his eyes cauſed a great dimnes, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt become blind, came full of hope to the holy Brothers Hearſe, &amp; knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling downe &amp; kiſſing his handes, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently all the paine ceaſed, and the little skinne which before couered the ball of his eyes falling away, he
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:19779:150"/>receiued his ſight moſt perfectly.</p>
               <p>And to the end that ſome there preſent might open the eyes of their mindes shut with incredulity, Bleſſed Alphonſus opened alſo his owne eyes which death had cloſed; a thing no leſſe admirable then profitable, that might conceaue a great opinion of his holines, whom almighty God did honour with ſo great miracles. For a certaine Prieſt amongſt the reſt not being very well contented to ſee the Viceroy, and all the Senate one after another to kiſſe the Bleſſed Brothers hands, yet leaſt he might giue offence by omitting that duety which all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did performe, reſolued with himſelfe, not to kiſſe the holy mans hands as others did, but comming with the reſt, to kiſſe the croſſe which he held in his hands, therby inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to conceale his thoughts from the ſtanders by, which yet he could not doe from the dead man. For as ſoone as he came neere, to the aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of all, the dead man ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

As ſonne as she was come to her ſelfe she made her Confeſſion to the Father, with the ſame ioy of mind wherwith she had receaued her corporall health. Being thus reſtored to the health both of body and minde, she liued after with much deuotion towards him, by whoſe meanes she receyued it.
